support the thread starter resolutely, i am replying to compose a poem.
pledge to fight to the death to defend diaoyu islands and related islands.
the fishing boat fleet was bumped, the little evil japanese ghost stirred up unrest and made trouble, they who have the heart of a thief and the arrogant form again showed their wolfish appearance.
never go back to that time when we appeared humiliatingly when we signed the treaty, china is strong, the sword is sharp, the knife is shining, let us bury the approaching enemy.

i agree with the thread starter's analysis, if the war really comes, i like to be hua mulan to protect our home, defend our homeland, spread our country's prestige, and pledge to fight to the death to defend our national dignity.
i wish i could have been born during that passionate, upsurge long march of mao zedong to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all the enemies of china and spread our dragon prestige.
how long have we tolerated japan?
i say to my fellow citizens...
hello everyone, we all know what happened on september 18th, but now japan is planning another premeditated incident at sea, similar to the lugou bridge incident, again.
surprisingly, japan defied the strong condemnation of the whole world, and openly invaded our sacred territory (diaoyu islands).
diaoyu islands have always belonged to china, we all know that, the reason why it has become controversial is because of historical reasons, originally we belong to china.
i ask my fellow citizens, why do we need negotiations? why does japan go even further, wanting to create a fact of occupation? can we allow this? absolutely not!
i say to my fellow citizens of japan, your militarism is bringing grave disaster to the people of asia.
china especially suffered from japan's ravages for several decades.
the japanese unit 731 conducted cruel and cruel human body experiments on chinese, korean and other people in the northeast region, the cruel experiments were conducted on living people with extremely brutal methods, the nanjing massacre added a layer of blood that will never fade away in the ancient capital city, the bloody and big battle in hengyang and changsha has barely over a thousand kilometers of the bones of the dead and killed everything.
i say to my fellow citizens, there are too many instances of heinous crimes committed by japan in china that are difficult to record without exhausting all the bamboo strips, it is impossible to cite them.
just like those 10 million deceased souls that lost their lives wandered over the pacific ocean and found it difficult to rest in peace.
still, all those who experienced that era remember it vividly, and even our younger generation also cries tears streaming down our cheeks and our blood boils with indignation when we turn to and read these pages of history.
actually, japan now wants to reverse the verdict on its aggressive history, so it's time for fellow citizens and asian chinese to wake up.
we must go forward, despite the pain of looking back at these 100 years of shame, we must create history and choose history, even if the historical issues are not resolved.
we have no fear because we are responsible. the territory is small but the matter is one of dignity. the honor of the country and the national unity is guaranteed by the interests of the country and the national unity regardless of how the wind and clouds change. we can not let our native land be separated by scars and wounds.
my fellow citizens, the 21 st century is an era of adventure for the chinese nation, and we are beset with difficulties from within, but are being pressed from without. we face many challenges.
how should we go about the taiwan issue, tibet issue, south china sea issue, surrounding environment, aggressive foreign forces against china, etc.?
fellow citizens, i ask what do you do? look at the world map and you will see that we are encircled by a crescent-shaped encirclement, suppressing our breath, strangling our development, coveting our national territory.
we never fear people, but we don't want to make our enemies, we don't fear war, but we don't want war.
we must urgently arrange our arms and strengthen all our military forces on land, at sea and in the air.
the chinese nation has never had an ambition to expand its territory outward, but chinese nations have flourished for several thousand years.
we follow a foreign security strategy that applies benevolence and virtue because we do not impose our own wants on others.
like individual tolerance and liberalism, the country is tolerant and liberal, but we must insist that we not hurt others, we must avoid hurting others.
tolerance is not a certain fear, sincerity is not cowardice.
china's exemption of japan from war reparations for world war ii serves the cause of peace and benevolence.
fellow citizens, i say the people's heroes monument is a condensed history of the chinese nation that has been striving for continuous improvement,
the magnificent posture of solemn expectation represents the sacred expectation of peace.
time to time, my memory string is agitated by the thought of the many stirring scenes of shining spears and armored horses that come to mind.
my thoughts went through those yellow pages of history like i saw the famous emperor kangxi, who alone in his audience hall a hundred years ago contemplated how to achieve territorial unification, and also former u.s. president abraham lincoln, who wandered alone in the dark great hall thinking about the integrity of the union.
yes, peace in the world is certainly dangerous to forget the war, but i say to my fellow citizens, we must never exercise forbearance with blind want, we want development and peace, but the boxer protocol, which is a betrayal and humiliation of the nation, aggravated the poverty and backwardness of china in modern times, and led to bullying behind the fall behind.
how come peace comes when the strong are not around?
we must focus on national defense education, build up a great wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people, and establish a full-range national defense system capable of attack and defense.
the best defense is a good offense, and the best offense is a good defense. we should strengthen the force that can engage in ultra-long-range attacks and improve the great-distance, deep-combat capability in all aerospace. under the premise of avoiding the influence of economic national development, you should increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment, and establish high-tech elite divisions of high quality.
the battle horn is about to sound, people are fully equipped and ready to go.
without the support of the people, we accomplish nothing, but with their support, we are all powerful.
fellow citizens, it is time when we say no to other people, we must achieve it.
1. establish a guaranteed fund and improve the working environment and mechanism, recruit millions of information technology professionals who have emigrated to the united states and around the world back to china.
2. create a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
3. manufacture 5,000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds.
4. accelerate research and deployment of high-speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles, which can break through missile defense systems.
5. resume nuclear experiments, establish military forces in space.
6. retain 1,000 nuclear bombs (equivalent to 100 million tons of trinitrotoluene) and install nuclear warheads on all short- and medium-range missiles as needed.
7. retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting three devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
8. abandon your commitment not to use nuclear weapons first.
9. retaining the right of preemptive strike in the face of a threat to national security.
my fellow citizens, only with confidence and improvement can we strive to be strong. qin shi huang unified china, zheng chenggong recovered taiwan, we must carry on the far-seeing insight and strong will of our predecessors.
that land that trembles far away from the embrace of the motherland is now shaking, moaning and calling. fellow citizens, let us carry forward courageously the unfulfilled wishes of the previous generals, and let us move forward with courage.
as i read history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmered, and i am concerned for my nation. however, i am willing to serve our country voluntarily to make our motherland prosper and be splendid once again, and i have no regrets even if i die. i bear to the cloth gown and i am one of the common people. i am adequate to show my sincere and patriotic heart to heaven.
i composed poems here in the classical ci form as a voice for my heart's aspirations.
paint your lips a deep red.
protect the diaoyu islands!
we lost our ryukyu islands bitterly.
how can we allow diaoyu islands to fall into other countries?
a hundred years of vicissitude.
smoke and clouds chase flying waves
the youngest brother was still a tender youth.
wandered all directions and the seal bore.
the flag was given a once-over.
we brandish our weapons and cross the east.
let the horses drink the pacific ocean.

why didn't we fight little japan?
what still tolerate the chinese people?
they even ride on our heads.
still, do the gutless chinese do this?
we should tell the whole world that china can not be bullied at will.
it's time to show our strength, china is too calm for too long.
currently, all of our citizens' lives are too careless, officials are too extravagant.
we are not going to have cohesion already now, china needs to start a war, the countries that follow the us rear will get a harsh slap in the face.
let them know the us is not a panacea, if we win, china's influence can increase, if we lose, we can clean out the incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out, let china have new blood and update, get china up.
go china!
i suggest that china strengthen its guard of the diaoyu islands, guard them every day, and protect the fishermen and our country's sovereignty. if japan dares to invade our territory by military force, we will fight a small-scale war of self-defense regardless of the cost. china can not lose.
we need to show in life, but really, when you show someone you are embraced by someone, p.
i just passed by.
this is like the whole society with the stars in it.
damn, not sexy.
it is totally unacceptable.
agree, just a cheap entertainer, somewhat makes sense of their reputation in feudal china.
their lives look glorious.
a group of 9 professionals
life is hard.
shock
that's normal, and the performers are always heartless whores and not righteous.
they want the money but not the face.
look at the wolf near ms. fan with glasses, you know the actor has to drink with him otherwise he will not be forced out or even framed.
son of a bitch.
as long as there's something lovely to eat, it's okay.
no one is easy, life is like a show, you have to look at the script to know how to perform.
all of them are somebody.
the top scorer in the imperial examination in all 360 life-time walks, so much effort and endeavor behind the top scorer in the imperial examination, this is humiliating to the word of bean vermicelli.
haha.
overdo.
reality
shoot that hooligan.
cheap performers
cheap performers
the entertainment circle is dirty, all the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
pity them, but who's to blame? those star females are not easy.
everybody does this, how can you make money if you don't?
when a woman is in front of other people, she is proud, but when she is alone, she is melancholy.
in ancient times, the popular stars were just the prostitutes, in plain words. nowadays, they are the stars who are famous for prostituting. so it is normal for them to drink or even sleep with some high officials.
stop talking to other people, just behave.
what should we do in the future? we're also facing such hard choices too, are we? alone capabilities are not enough to succeed.
the glorious look is undisputedly a disguise for more suffering.
the problem is that they just play in their own circle, not seeing or keeping in mind things outside of their circle.
but there is an old guy named zhang jizhong who behaves like a hooligan in his circle and also thinks he is virtuous without talent, he makes a tv series when he has nothing to do to wreck the whole country's people.
both took what they needed.
when can china have a pure and innocent girl?
the story now is very shocking in the entertainment world, rumors are that hsu yuki was forced out of the show because she refused to drink with the guests arranged by the company, and she had to switch to working as a lawyer's assistant to make an end meet instead.
the star superheroes, much envied, often encounter unwelcome social engagements or circumstances that they must join in, but would rather not.
after all, many things are decisions that have to do with many aspects and the interests of many people, so they can not decide on many things.
sometimes, the very normal dinner party that we ordinary people would imagine to be so simple for a star cann't be that simple.
stars have a lot of contracts and if they are tackled well their money sources will roll in, if she doesn't tackle well she will come to heel by force or even frame.
there are two kinds of smart female stars: one kind is always holding a very high integrity, and will sternly reject all such invitations.
the second kind of people are good at playing tricks and achieving their objectives with their own seed money.
rumor has it that even some super star females have won their first roles this way.
after drinking some alcohol, advertisers or sponsors of the show can have a chance to lie on the star female's shoulder, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, and the most adopted attitude is endurance.
they are the very lowest of the nine professions.
those stars are just pretending, and actually living a much better life than this.
agree, just a cheap entertainer, somewhat makes sense of their reputation in feudal china.
agree.
oh well, not an easy actor.
they deserve it, they asked for it.
nothing is easy for me, dawn.
women are birds and beasts, and men are worse.
brawk!
brawk!
it doesn't take long.
route 288, a circumferential highway running around the southwest quadrant of the richmond-new urban region, opened in late 2004.
it already changes the development pattern and worsens it, causing localized traffic congestion around its exits.
the richmond times dispatch tells the tale of the impact of the huguenot trail in powhatan county today.
will jones reports that traffic on one section of huguenot trail has more than doubled since 288 opened.
speed and accidents are surging as well.
so far this year, there have been 17 accidents near the intersection of winterfield road, up from 12 all of 2004.
dale totten, a residential engineer with the virginia department of transportation, notes that if the state had more money, it could have four lanes on the road for about $ 13 million.
of course vdot doesn't have the money to construct roads in the richmond region.
because vdot is spending all their frigging money on 288 because of local politicians and boosters.
where is homer simpson when you need him?
this is a major moment, doh!
we predict that route 288 will generate residential development in the scarce populated areas all around the exit, which will overtax the local country road.
others choose where they work and where they live, but limited access highways can relieve traffic for drivers between chesterfield and goochland counties back and forth.
and they create traffic congestion in new places.
i'm only surprised at this rapidity.
i even think there could be a 3-4 year lag.
think about it, route 288 has already created a $ 13 million dollar construction just at this one exit, so the road is going to create liability for all of its exits.
another predictable thing.
the need for new road improvements soared after a few more years of scattered subdivision development and the approval of a mega-commerce project at the intersection of 288 and a major road.
well, by the end of the decade we should be able to see the unfunded liability zoom past the original $ 400 million that was taken to build the original highway.
the idea says that the brainiac who thought such a great idea was route 288.
i thank you for nothing.
i think we could spend $ 4 billion elsewhere better.
i don't think you should blame 288 for creating those people.
if they are enough to create new traffic congestion in a new place, what's the alternative?
additional traffic congestion in old places?
now you understand what tmt in fairfax feels like.
i usually take the road position.
288 is definitely an excess, but there is a glaring need in other parts of the state.
richmond has virtually no traffic.
the rush hour lasts 30 minutes.
and you give them the beltway through a large rural area.
nowhere to go.
just think, this money could be spent on another potomac river crossing facility or on desperately needed road improvements in nova.
virginia centrist, the insult is that the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in last year's budget deal, adding insult to injury, and that wiped out the debt.
it's very nice of you all to oblige us.
but it doesn't make much sense.
the same old problem.
if you get ahead of the need, you're going to be accused of causing sprawl.
if you build in a place where there is already an acute need, you cann't pave your way out of congestion.
anonymous ·
that's fair enough.
5:26 is a good point.
but this situation is hammering home the validity of what the state auditor's report found: that ctb and vdot are funding transportation projects based on the best lobbying, instead of on a comprehensive state transportation plan.
i submit this intolerable and disgraceful situation should not be tolerated.
and senator chichester and his toadies are pouring more money into this flawed institution, making it worse.
what is the purpose of transportation expenditures?
in virginia, it's for the benefit of private business plans, not for the public interest.
you all are dead wrong.
walter stoch, not less, stated that the money for economic development was intended for the 288 road.
come on folk.
tmt, i don't understand your point.
when was the last time you stuck in traffic and didn't go to some sort of business or go to one?
to me, it seems the whole point of the road is to facilitate the public's interest in getting and from private business.
despite the sunday drive, grandmother's location trip and soccer game, there is an overwhelming need for business support.
it is no wonder we suffer from congestion problems because what we expend on roads does not match the increase in business or state domestic products.
if we recognize that roads are primarily a business benefit, then we should do two things:
so businesses will pay more of their transportation bills to us, and we will incentivize them to locate where the system is least stressed, even if that means more overall travel.
why is it so hard to understand?
the solution is to solve the functional settlement pattern and the balance between the transport system's capacity and the travel demand generated by land use.
all else is spin.
emr,
tmt said it was for the benefit of private business plans and not for the public interest in virginia.
i don't see the point of this statement as it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else.
i think they are intertwined and tightly so that they are virtually the same.
this cookie dough is lumpy, obviously a local problem.
but if we demonize business long enough, eventually we will find that all of us work with the devil in aggregate.
i don't see the point in claiming to have solved the balance of a dynamic, ever changing nature.
even you would see the rail to dulles as a positive because it is a job center that promotes bidirectional demand.
i agree.
in fact, that may be all that is necessary, that is, that the reason for building it is that it was built.
all i'm saying is that the same logic should be applied to the roads.
they should have a destination at both ends so that we can use our investment to the maximum.
we need more places to get closer to the balance you say we need.
reality check here.
i drive past watkins landing every morning and evening.
i commute back and forth to where i work on huguenot trail.
i never see anything remotely like a traffic flood.
it's a 55 mph zone where cars are going 75-100 mph in the morning.
the road widening plan for huguenot trail is already in the works because of the heavy development demands on the chesterfield side, the new school, and the whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned years ago before robious road was a funnel.
288 is a wonderful road for those of us who actually use it, instead of the bottleneck of lack of 288 that powhatan and western chesterfield county are.
we can develop commercially and work closer to our lives.
you can think that is irrational use of land.
i don't desire to live in any city.
i refuse to work in the downtown area.
i refuse to use mass transit that is unsafe for female commuters who work long irregular hours.
and i like the idea of a large lot developing.
i don't understand exactly how i'm supposed to keep a horse on a quarter acre lot.
a gallon of gas could go for $ 10.
and i still pay for my life in the country.
many people legitimately prefer horses, hunting, gardens, and certain types of small businesses that make them not want to live in the urban core.
this infatuation with city life truly baffles me.
every person has the right to live in the country if they wish to, anonymous 6:37.
but you don't have the right to have the rest of the state underwrite a $ 400 million highway construction to make shopping and getting work easier.
in the debate over 288, there has been a consistent overlooking of other things that could be spent for $ 400 million.
much of the traffic congestion could be alleviated if the money was applied to other pressing road projects or even forbidden non-road projects.
ray hyde, my comments were directed at investors who lobby for roads to be placed near their own property and the incompetent system that funds these requests regardless of whether they are linked to a master transportation plan or not.
i am 24 and my son is 2.5 years old.
i have been broken up with my sons father since august.
i want to start dating other people and my son's father says if i do that it has nothing to do with him.
he is very possessive and controlling, but he doesn't have the right to be because we are together.
his life is going on too much right now and although i've told him several times that i don't love him and he doesn't love me, i think we can work.
i want him there for his son, not too, but i don't need him either.
but he has no one, his family doesn't get along with him and they have issues with him.
i don't want to be miserable anymore, and the longer he's around, the more miserable i get.
i don't want him there without his son, because he's a good father or at least tries to be.
i believe every child needs both parents, whether they are together or not.
but he thinks no one can have me if he cann't.
what am i doing with my life?
it's very bad to threaten you with your ex-significant other using your son.
you have to give in to that, it just escalates if you do.
you are right to live your life and be happy, so there is no reason to cave in to his threats.
if he really loved his son, he would see him regardless, but this is just the typical method of control used by people like him.
other people say things like " if you leave me, i'll kill myself " - does it get through to you?
date:
meet all kinds of people.
do what you want to do.
if the price of walking out of your own life was that of voluntarily walking out of the life of someone you both know, you'd probably be better off without him.
i agree, other than that he's not a businessman unless you date him.
i didn't tell him.
he's not threatening you, he's not concerned about your personal life.
can you document his threats?
you really need to...
quit taking his calls and make him leave voice mail.
make him email or text you.
keep that record.
get a lawyer and divorce.
if you cann't afford one, try legal aid.
tell your ex-significant other that all communications need to go through a lawyer.
the bus driver, the people in till, and the people who deliver your food want the exact change.
they don't realize that you don't get change from the bank?
someone has to take notes somewhere?
people get lazy.
i like to be as near as possible, because i don't like counting copper all day.
if you take a twenty pound note on the bus, they'll just tell you to get the bus, because they're as lazy as hell.
it is not legal to pay a certain amount in a load of coins, for example you can only pay 30 pence using 1 pence coins.
hello, i started university in september but i obviously didn't gel with it immediately like most people.
i know that adjusting will take some time for me, because i'm very introverted, shy, anxious and all that rest.
on the first night i was here, all my housemates and i went out and it was the hardest thing i've ever had to do.
i go to the student union bar by myself when i'm sober.
however, the more important point is here:
i didn't enjoy university after being here for about 5 months. the course disillusioned me, i didn't enjoy the set projects and i much dislike the way the course is delivered.
the university made out much better than it seemed.
i started the first term badly, student finance was delayed adding to the level of stress i was under and i was so worried i was unable to progress with my work, in the end all the piles were concluded.
my counselor was assigned to me through the university and i saw him in block sessions for about 5-6 weeks and honestly, it didn't really work out because i never opened up to him.
only half a heart.
i'm loaded to the neck with work now, have to hit major deadlines, depressed and anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time.
i no longer have a counselor, because you can only have one at a time, so many times, and i doubt that having one now would help me much if i were not already helped by one.
i lack motivation, i don't feel comfortable with my lecturer, i feel like i want to give in but i cann't because i end up with a dead end job and i aspire to be someone.
i'd rather die than be uneducated and not living the life i want to live, and i've made matters worse by dropping out of university.
i'm 21 and turning 22 this year, i don't have much time left to fail and i have to do something.
once i failed college and did another course so i could get into university, i don't want to go through the system over and over and fail consistently.
can someone give me some advice?
maybe you can go and see your doctor and see if there is any way you can get an extension to your deadline to try and ease the pressure a bit.
send your tutor an email like this post, and consider the mitigating circumstances. they will have seen all this before, and i know, having worked in the university administration department, they will not worry about it.
break your work into manageable chunks.
concentrate on one bit of work at a time (obviously start with the most urgent assignment).
don't shut off your housemates, do well because you are trying new things from the very beginning, keep it now.
i would recommend you go to see your doctor too.
if you're always an anxious person, speaking to someone can benefit you. my friend got therapy from the nhs because of anxiety, it's really normal.
try to get an extension, if you are honest i'm sure your university would allow it.
it's hard to keep strong and keep on living.
my mum got divorced, and she had a horrible time with my stepfather, and she was sent round the bend by her new found freedom.
she has epilepsy and manic depressive with a huge anger problem.
she was constantly horrible to me.
i cann't cope with what she bursts out with and the hateful, nasty remarks she makes when i'm at home.
i am an 18 year old person who has a 95 % bursary, studying full time in a high pressure private school in 6 th form at the point of my break.
i cann't work from home because she shouts at me.
then i got angry at my teacher because...
she was lovely for one minute, like i had my mummy back, and then she turned into the most spiteful living human next minute.
i didn't pass my a2 exams and i've already accepted that i've been defeated and that this part of my life has made me fail.
i don't know if i can come back, but the university offered me the most amazing offer, but i cann't even accept it, i never made a grade.
i wish i could wipe her out of my life, but without her things would be so much better.
but then i think i'm just selfish.
but surely that doesn't mean i'm living like this, does it?
it should be so much better.
but i feel like i have no control over this downhill spiral.
and i don't know what to do.
thanks for reading.
nice vent.
you cann't get her section because of that.
even has she a history of mental illness or a diagnosis?
you don't know for sure that you won't get a good grade, so you accept the place if you can.
life will throw things at you all the time.
outsider if someone who isn't a member of your family.
i had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for 8 years before i came to university, and honestly i'm here because that's the only way out for it.
if you really want out, work hard.
really, if she cann't give you consistent support, you'll need support from somewhere else.
can you call childline or something similar?
you can go to the library on saturday and study there for 8 hours good.
can you go to your friend's house to form a study group?
you want to section her because the section is a bit painful in the ass and you blame it for all your problems?
i know how you feel.
my mum spits from hell too.
i'm highly in favour of smoking up.
oh, tsr, grow up and stop nagging, it's a joke.
i think i became much weaker over the past year or so and i've been way down dulling my personality to try and befriend some people at uni.
but being overly nice leads people to believe that they can say whatever they want to me or do whatever they want to me.
they showed absolute disrespect.
for example, i say hello to someone from the university and they ignore me, but 30 minutes later they decide they want my help with some work and i give it.
it's caused a lot of anger and distress in my life, and it's really starting to affect my concentration at uni.
anyone got any experience of handling this sort of thing or how to go about getting some respect again?
just say no.
if you are not particularly comfortable with it, do it gradually.
sorry i'm not able to start, but i'm busy.
of course, you don't go over the top, you don't go in the completely opposite direction.
if you think no, then say no, mind you.
when they start to realize that you are not going to bend over backwards for them, they will start to respect you more.
this is really such a bad attitude, well you cann't respect you if you are nice but not to the point that you just let them do anything to you, that's not nice but foolish person.
i don't know if anyone will read this, but i just feel despair and the need to tell someone.
i left home in september and started university, i was incredibly anxious about doing this but i delayed thinking about it until i got here, now i'm here and i've been here for over two weeks, i feel overwhelmed by it all and i feel unintelligent and socially awkward.
i have been emotionally struggling since i moved to secondary school (roughly 15 months ago), although i lost my dad around the age of 9 and i always used to blame my feelings on that, since i moved to secondary school i have had two periods of counselling (roughly 15 months in total)
i feel like i'm having a moment where i'm overwhelmed by the problems in my life that are not credible and i'm making myself doubt my always low self esteem more and more. i cann't concentrate on work, i find myself becoming very quiet at social occasions often and i doubt myself about anything and everything.
two counselors i have seen have not diagnosed me with depression and have suggested i am not suffering from it, but i am worried about depression because my dad died of it and committed suicide, and i am worried about depression because of that.
i have tried to solve my problems before, and i have found exercise and meditation particularly useful, i have also tried things like self-help books and tapes, but generally speaking i feel that this is what my life is, and that this is what being a young man is. i am wasting one chance at existence, one chance at being a young man.
i simply don't know what to do, and i never follow through on what i think i should do, my friends often say i'm lazy, and i cann't disagree a lot of the time, i feel like they're trying everything they can to help, and i fail time and time again.
sorry to anyone who read this jumbled mess, i feel a bit like a self-seeking moaner but i'm truly desperate.
it is common for people to feel more intense emotions towards each other when they are in a new situation and feeling pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into a new role, such as a university student.
i'm not a professional in healthy, and i can only speak from my own experience, so i would strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings and worries about depression.
most people feel stupid and awkward when they get to university for the first time, so you definitely aren't alone there. i would really recommend getting an appointment with your university's counselling service, but that's really a matter of whether you want to tell anyone whether you're depressed or not. you obviously have some problems at the minute, and you might need some support, but that's not really a matter of anyone telling you whether you are or not. you have some problems obviously, but you might be able to use some support, and meditation and exercise are really helpful, but you have to engage with help and general life to get somewhere. a lot of people feel like this, and it's hopefully something that will pass when you begin to feel better. don't be unkind to yourself, that will only worsen your feelings.
good luck.
i think a lot more people feel the same way as you do, but they medicate themselves by using their friends, whereas that probably isn't the solution as such, but being around your friends when you're depressed is definitely better than being alone and depressed, either way if you fancy a chat you're free to message me privately.
if you were me, i'd focus on idol. you aspire to be someone like someone who comes from a bad background and ends up succeeding, happy, having a family, marrying etc. but you don't want to be them.
focus on what you have achieved in life, not what you are studying or indeed why you are studying it - do you want to experience it? because your mum wants you to go? because you need a degree for the career you want?
you sum up why you're there and work off the bottom of your own grade to get the best grade you can have something to say when you get your degree like " hey, i didn't fail, i worked hard and passed " either way.

i hope this helps.
i'm not autistic (i was not diagnosed with dyspraxia, but i think it was a misdiagnosis by the doctor) but i walk on my toes nearly all the time.
it's more comfortable for me.
how do they make the decision that toe walking is a sign of autism when it seems so random and not always an indicator?
well, i could have something that is on the autism spectrum, but i don't have one or two things that are on the autism spectrum.
you guys know what i mean.
walking on toes could be a symptom of autism.
headaches can be a symptom of a brain tumor.
feeling tired a lot could be a symptom of leukaemia.
symptoms are not always applicable, but are worth noting in this instance as they are clearly a lot of the time, so without them a diagnosis of nothing would ever be made.
i used to walk on my toes, but now i walk because i have strange toes that curl under and had to be surgically straightened two years ago.
my brother is autistic, but i didn't notice it either, but the spectrum is so broad, and i probably have a mild case of asperger's, so i have communication problems and don't pick up on social/body language reactions.
but then i don't have the proper diagnosis and you may even have some symptoms but that doesn't mean you have a certain condition.
i've been told for years that i don't walk on my toes, so i don't walk on my toes much.
i have dyspraxia.
so you could be dyspraxic or have short tendons.
drilled it to the point where i find it more comfortable now.
i haven't read too much about random symptoms like that.
hello, i am a 12 year old girl (which means i will be 13 in 2 days) and i am addicted to self harm.
i started slitting my own individual fingers with scissors when i was 7 years old and never stopped from that day on.
it got worse because i have a scar on my leg from when i slit my leg open with a stapler for the name of my ex-boyfriend because i didn't stop cutting until i bled.
i have several slits in my arms.
they healed, and then i cut myself with a staple i robbed from school and a razor.
when i couldn't find a cutting tool i took around 5 paracetamol and other drugs and took them with lager and vodka.
i really am tempted to cut my arm off or burn myself to death while writing this.
i'm an addict, i cut again when one heals.
i think about it every day.
i'm 12 and my life is already sick.
this is from a source who my dad left me at 7 years old and didn't want to know me anymore.
he just cares about his new little girl, his wife and his new life that i don't want.
my best mate died at 10 years old.
i have a relationship with a 16 year old boy and i am forbidden to speak to him because of events and the age difference.
my mum also suffers from bipolar and i have depression.
i don't want to stop.
i don't care what i do, i want to do it over and over again to torture myself, i hate myself.
but i love my best mate to death, he means the world to me, if he does anything i do it.
i didn't tell him, but he found out.
i don't want to hurt him, i don't want him to hurt himself.
what do i do?
thanks for reading.
or are you on any drugs and if so, do they get any therapy?
talk to your school nurse or your gp and tell them what's going on.
there are teachers you can trust who you can tell.
if you tell people, they might be able to help you.
if you keep it bottled up inside, it's only going to get worse.
trust me, getting this thing as early as possible is better than letting it even worsen.
please don't do this.
i'm 17 and started self harming (mainly cutting my arms) last year but i stopped a few months ago.
it's hard, but you can do it.
i feel so much happier than i did, but seeing the scars reminds me of how i felt at that time, and how strong those feelings were, that i wanted to do such things to myself, it's painful.
also strong, you can do it, i found it saved by writing poetry and keeping a journal.
self harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
remember, self harm does not define who you are.
you can overcome it.
i've been finding myself always checking to make sure i've got everything i belong to when i go out (especially to university) in the past year, so i'm thinking i'm getting ocd.
i often have to check twice as often as i go, and then after 30 seconds i cann't resist checking again for some reason.
why is this?
or i'm crazy or something?
it is often, but not most of the time, and even still checks many times a day, and it carries many things, but rarely carries anything, is this ocd to any extent?
what can i do with this?
if i don't check, i get very anxious, sort of goes away after 15-30 minutes, but often the anxiety is so much that i cann't wait that long.
i feel doomed if i lose my wallet or phone.
i just wish i could go out without having to worry every two minutes whether i'm leaving something or losing something.
i really don't know what to do, and i'm afraid to go to a general practitioner.
probably never heard of some compulsion like this, i just don't know what to do.
do any of you have a similar ritual?
people think i'm crazy but it's very strange how difficult it is to get yourself out of this.
perhaps you could advise me on what?
i used to do this on my way to college, had a list of items i knew i had on me and used to do a compulsive check on the bus.
i have more severe anxiety now and i think this is a warning sign, so just try to wean off the habit when it's relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor, but also tell them not to keep checking this thing.
the doctor saw a much worse case, so don't worry about that.
i did a presentation on ocd in my psychology class today.
so, just avoiding compulsive acts is one way to avoid losing it, so don't check if you lost something and just leave it.
your anxiety levels will increase over time, but your ocd will gradually decrease, hopefully disappearing over time.
that just sounds like you're over anxious instead of having ocd really bad.
i am very obsessive to the point where i get up at 2 am every night to check that all the locks in my house are particularly locked.
sometimes i'm convinced they're not locked, but i know they are.
i think when it starts to really interrupt your daily routine, it becomes a real problem.
you definitely aren't crazy so don't worry about it and i'm sure your gp will understand the issue.
i also go for therapy for other reasons, and they encourage me to pick a number of less than 20 times to check, and stick to it, and cut down.
i think the idea is to teach me, and i'm still ok if i check in 5 times or 20 times.
i'm a lot better so far, and i think anyone who wants to improve will definitely do so.
i'm usually pretty calm about things, i like to take things as they come and i'm not too worried about much.
but i've been finding myself becoming really anxious about things over the past month or two, and i'm not talking about mere feelings of nervousness from the blues.
i began to feel a panic, a rationality that i had not felt beforehand, too much, about a variety of things that had come to mind as something that would cause alarm bells to ring in my head.
i'm not sure if this is the cause of this lifestyle change (going from a care-free student to an unemployed graduate) or if it's a sign of other issues, but this is beginning to bug me because it's affecting my confidence and happiness.
i spoke to a few people including my parents about it, but everyone thinks i'm going through random phases and should hold off on acting until it's clear there's a serious problem.
so what's the best thing to do?
so speak to the doctor and see if there is anything that the anti anxiety pills can take the edge off from that?
i see i can speak to a counselor?
or should i take the advice of the people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem?
well, you should not start trying to keep your eye on your anxiety, because that will make you tense and more likely to panic, which is a vicious circle there.
when you start to feel a bit panicky about anything, i would recommend you try to focus on something that will make you smile or feel happier.
or if you cann't do that, get your friends to make you laugh when you start to feel panicky, that'll work for me, i suffer random panic attacks and i'm laughing out loud!
i started to just get really worried about the tiny things, but it doesn't sound like you're as severe as i am.
i find just talking to someone else about what makes you anxious helps.
i find that when i mention my worries to my mum, and see her reaction to the situation in a calm way that i should react in, it makes me feel better about it, so i know that it's not a big deal and i don't need to be anxious about it.
but if it worsens, go to the doctor.
i have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety which can prevent her from leaving the house and doing things because she worries so much about what might go wrong.
the doctor gave her medication and it made her much better.

some 2,500 university students, the main form of protest, formed a human chain in osaka on sunday with japanese characters spelling out " no war " to protest the ongoing us-led military campaign in iraq.
20-year-old rally organizer miyako fuji told the jiji news agency that " we can not forgive this war. "
i want to join together with each of us as individuals who oppose the war to feel.
according to the news publication jiji, protesters carrying placards reading " stop the war " and " love and peace " exceeded the number of people expected to show up at osaka castle park in the city's downtown neighborhood, carrying placards and forming human chains after 3:00 pm (6:00 am gmt).
the protests followed a string of other protests involving tens of thousands of peace activists across japan since january.
according to a kyodo news agency poll released saturday, 78 of 100 surveyed people opposed military action in iraq.
a separate yomiuri newspaper poll of 1,846 adults showed 64 percent felt japan has no choice but to back the united states, while only 12 percent said japan has every reason to back the war.
british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown named the current head of britain's energy regulator on tuesday as the new chairman of the financial services authority's (fsa) financial watchdog.
in september, when incumbent howard davies stepped down, callum mccarthy, a former senior banker, began one of the most important jobs in the london financial world.
davies left to become chairman of the london school of economics, one of the best known parts of the university of london.
brown said mccarthy would bring a combination of non-rival experience in the public sector, senior industry practice in the financial services sector and a highly successful chairman of a highly successful regulator to the fsra.
mccarthy currently heads the office of gas and electricity markets, which regulates britain's privatized energy industry.
mccarthy, who previously held senior positions at barclays bank, barclays capital and kleinwort benson, is a former civil servant at the department of trade and industry.
in november 2001, the financial services authority (fsa) became the sole regulator of financial services in britain, taking on various functions from nine separate agencies, watched over by davies.
a tribe mob hacked to death at least three members of a family in the northeastern indian state of tripura over allegations that they practiced witchcraft, police said thursday.
on wednesday, a group of 25 to 30 armed men attacked a house belonging to a quack doctor from a village 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of the tripuras capital agartala, the spokesman said.
a mob dragged three members of the family out and killed them with machetes and spears before fleeing the area, a spokesman said by telephone from agartala.
a 55-year-old quack doctor named nityalila naotia and his teenage son, and another unidentified family member, died.
naotia is a practicing sorcerer and has cast evil spells on the villagers with his black magic, according to the spokesman, prompting the group to eliminate them.
police arrested four people in connection with the killings.
superstitious beliefs, black magic and demonology are integrated into tribal customs in parts of tripura and other northeastern states of india.
many tribes practice a faith that mixes black magic and superstition, which they believe.
30 people died during a week of unseasonal rain in oman.
muscat, april 19
police said saturday 30 people, including five indians, four pakistanis and a family from the united arab emirates swept away in their car during a week of unseasonal heavy rains in oman, had died.
seven-member family was killed when a wadi (dry river) overflowed due to rains in the wilayat region near the border with the uae, police spokesman abdullah al-harthy said we have recovered seven bodies and the vehicle.
5 indians and 4 pakistanis died, according to indian and pakistani embassy officials.
the decomposed body of dharam datt choyal, a rajasthan state construction worker, was found friday, said bhupinder singh, first secretary of the indian embassy.
two other indian workers were still missing after choyal's truck was swept away by a flash flood in the capital muscat on monday.
police reported wednesday that 16 people have died since the rains began two days ago.
the sun was out on saturday and traffic was running normally in the capital.
a wet spell that started with a bang on monday seems to be ending, according to meteorological officials.
muscat's largest market, muttrah souq, reopened saturday after three days of knee-deep flooding.
a pakistani court in central punjab province sentenced a christian man to life imprisonment for blasphemy, police said sunday.
faisalabad industrial district court judge shahid rafiq found ranjha masih guilty of defiling verses from the koran at a 1998 rally by the minority christian community in protest.
they said the judge also ordered ranjha to pay a fine of 50,000 rupees (about 870 us dollars) in a verdict handed down saturday.
ranjha is accused of tearing down koranic verse billboards in faisalabad during christian demonstrations after the faisalabad bishop committed suicide over a 1985 blasphemy law.
in 1998, catholic bishop of faisalabad john joseph shot ayub masih in the head outside a court in the sahiwal district, after the judge convicted ayub masih under the blasphemy law.
ayub masih was charged in 1996 with blasphemy for allegedly defending british author salman rushdie, whose novel `` the satanic verses '' infuriated radical muslim clerics who accused rushdie of defaming islam.
last year, the pakistan supreme court acquitted ayub masih, who denied uttering words against islam or the prophet mohammad.
blasphemy is a death-penalty offense under pakistan's penal code.
however, blasphemy convicts have never been executed in the country.
christian rights activists say the anti-blasphemy law introduced by late military dictator general zia-ul-haq is mainly used to persecute christians or settle land feuds.
the french media group vivendi universal is in advanced negotiations to sell its theme park business to a us firm for around 1.5 billion dollars, the los angeles times said on friday.
the report comes as the group said it plans to sell off its us vivendi universal entertainment unit and other assets to focus on telecoms activities and its french cable tv business.
the times said vivendi universal is in negotiations to sell its flagship theme park to new york investment firm blackstone group, a first step in vivendi's dismantling of its entertainment empire.
vivendi universal officials in the united states were immediately unavailable for comment friday.
blackstone group is reportedly planning to buy vivendi's theme park division, which includes universal studios hollywood, universal orlando in florida and the company's interest in owning parks in spain and japan, according to sources close to the buyout negotiations, the paper reported.
blackstone already holds a 50 percent stake in two parks that make up universal orlando.
vivendi confirmed months of press speculation this week that it plans to shed its entertainment assets, including the famous movie studio universal and its television assets, before the end of the year.
chief executive jean-rene fourtou told shareholders at the annual general meeting tuesday that the sale of vivendi univeral entertainment was a major goal for 2003 and that negotiations were already underway.
fourtou said he had not yet received a firm offer from his us music giant, universal music group, and had not taken a final decision on its future.
once-mighty french utility group is obliged to reshape itself to slash its huge debt of around 18 billion dollars.
the group recorded a net loss of 2.33 billion euros (3.0 billion dollars) in 2002, the biggest ever in france.
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom stressed wednesday the role of qatar in the middle east peace process during talks with his qatari counterpart sheik hamad bin jassem bin jabr al-thani in paris.
shalom told a joint press conference that the strong relations between the tiny gulf state and the recently appointed palestinian prime minister mahmud abbas could boost peace.
we are discussing the middle east peace process.
shalom said during our one-hour talk that we asserted that both the israeli and arab worlds are parties and that we are willing to do everything to return to the negotiating table.
qatar is a very important country for this issue.
he who uses the alternative name abbas said he knows the foreign minister of qatar has a special relationship with abu mazen.
shalom had his first meeting with an arab counterpart since taking office as israel's foreign minister on february 27.
qatar has economic links with israel despite not maintaining diplomatic relations, facing criticism from other arab countries.
shalom later flew to london to talk to british prime minister tony blair and foreign secretary jack straw.
the white house said on tuesday that us president george w. bush told canadian prime minister jean chretien in a telephone conversation on monday that he looked forward to seeing him at upcoming summits with major industrialized nations and russia.
bush spokesman ari fleischer said the two leaders will discuss the upcoming g-8 meeting, us-canadian relations and other international concerns in the days before the june 1-3 summit in france.
both said they were looking forward to seeing each other in evian.
fleischer said they will also touch on afghanistan, the situation in the democratic republic of the congo and the global economy.
amid a chill in relations over the iraq war, bush has not definitely postponed a visit to canada, instead choosing to host australian prime minister john howard, a military war campaign endorser.
chretien told reporters monday that he and bush spoke for the first time since late february about a wide range of issues, including iraq, the upcoming group of eight industrial powers summit and aid to africa.
we're always good for a term.
the canadian leader said we disagree on just one item.
the chief of a main opposition party in the indian congress told an election rally that the prime minister and president were bachelors because india was suffering from the curse of nature, a report said saturday.
the times of india, a national newspaper, quoted madhya pradesh state minister digvijay singh as saying that indian prime minister and chief atal behari vajpayee and president abdul kalam were offending the hindu rain god varuna by remaining bachelors.
the country is ruled by a bachelor president and a non-married prime minister.
singh said the hindu shastra or book of religious texts said this was not a very auspicious time and it would cause widespread heatwaves and drought.
he added that the bachelor status of president kalam, instead of just prime minister vajpayee, was making the country an arid and barren one that is not fertile.
pramod mahajan, secretary general of vajpayee's ruling bharatiya janata party, retorted that singh's statement was contemptible and beneath contempt.
india reels from heatwave since mid-may that has killed 1403 people.
rajasthan, the western desert state, is also bracing for a straight five years of drought.
the skeleton of the second baby was found in a rural wisconsin home where a 22-year-old woman's dead infant was discovered in a blue plastic container on june 8, officials said monday.
kristin scott, the mother, told police she secretly gave birth to two babies, one in april 2001, a sexually unknown baby, and another, a full-term girl, on jan. 14, at her parents' home in byrds creek, richland county.
police arrested her saturday in abilene, texas, where she moved with a friend on june 2.
she was held on $ 50,000 bail on charges of first-degree reckless homicide and hiding a corpse when a january infant was born.
scott told police that she had not been tending to the baby and that the baby had died 30 minutes later.
she said the baby must die, according to the criminal complaint.
after going through what the source of the foul odor in their house was, william and nancy scott found the decomposing body of the first baby in the women's closet.
scott told investigators that he had moved that body into the byrds creek house's sometimes closet, his car's trunk and his apartment in richland center, wisconsin, before he moved around texas, according to the complaint.
the sheriff has not released other details about the second baby.
palestinian security forces returned to their positions held in the gaza strip before the outbreak of the 33-month palestinian uprising on monday, according to a palestinian source in the force, as israel removed all major checkpoints in the coastal territory.
police officers, who have enjoyed freedom of movement since the intifada exploded in september 2000, have taken up positions across the gaza strip, sources said.
the palestinian police took over all posts and positions held before 28 september 2000.
they have been free to move around in cars and with weapons since the start of the intifada, according to sources.
the move marked a huge step forward in carrying out the middle east roadmap, backed by the united states, which aims to end months of bloodshed and create a lasting peace between israel and the palestinians.
police have taken up positions there and in the neighboring town of beit lahiya, he said, following the israeli troop withdrawal from the northern town of beit hanoun late sunday.
they also deployed along the israeli border.
the handover test the palestinian authority, which must show it is credible when hardline groups plotting attacks on the jewish state come in for reinforcement.
another first in almost three years, the israeli intifada (army) allowed palestinians to circulate freely on the trans-gaza highway as troops abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastal territory.
after the army withdrew, traffic flowed freely at the netzarim junction south of gaza city, the kissufim junction near deir al-balah in central gaza and the guest house junction just south of gaza city.
three military checkpoints on the highway that runs the entire length of the gaza strip transformed the trip south to north from an ordinary 30-minute ride into a grinding ordeal of two or three hours, coming to symbolize the horrors of occupation.
israel has implemented most of the agreements except for a few issues, according to sources who pointed out that israel still has military observation posts at the kissufim and guest house junctions.
he said several other roads remained temporarily closed but there was free movement along the trans-gaza highway.
the karni-netzarim road, which runs east-west across the route, and a section of the highway that passes just south of the guest house junction to kfar darom, are still closed, he said, adding that they are likely to open in the coming week.
another road leading to the southern border town of rafah and khan yunis will open up in the next 10 days, he said.
israeli military sources confirmed that troops had installed gates at the netzarim and guest house junctions in response to palestinian complaints, but said the troops were only there at times when jewish settlers needed to use the roads.
the ban on allowing palestinian men under 35 to move freely is still in force, but is expected to be lifted on monday or early tuesday.
the army also handed over control of the rafah border crossing, which crosses between the gaza strip and egypt, to palestinians, according to security sources.
six palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the palestinian section of the border crossing, which israel troops took over shortly after the rise-up started.
the 1993 oslo accord granted the palestinians autonomy measures, but the israelis and palestinians jointly managed the rafah border crossing with egypt, with israel having final control of the zone.
israel has been managing the palestinian section for more than two years, but crossings for movement between the two territories are open in principle, although israel frequently closes them for reasons that are rarely explained.
witnesses said five iraqi civilians, including a woman, were killed monday when their house was hit by a missile fired by a us-led coalition warplane.
they said their house was located in one of baghdad's most populous areas, al-azamiyah district.
one house was destroyed in the strike and casualties were removed from the area.
the us-led coalition launched a new round of air strikes in baghdad at 1430 (1130 gmt) monday.
they said they heard huge explosions in different parts of the iraqi capital baghdad and that air raid sirens were sounding in the city and that iraqi artillery had begun firing back at the aircraft.
despite repeated assurances from coalition leaders that they would make every effort to minimize civilian casualties in the current iraq war, at least 130 iraqi civilians have been reported killed in the first five days of the war.
according to other reports reaching here, five syrian bus passengers were killed and 10 others injured sunday morning when a bus traveling near the iraqi border was hit by a us missile.
the vehicle carried syrian refugees fleeing war in iraq.

lack of precautions blamed for avalanche accident in northwest china
menyuan county, northwest china, on april 5
the search for two missing outdoors tourists from an avalanche in northwest china's qinghai province continued tuesday, and lack of precautions on the part of the tourists, which had already left one dead, was listed as the main reason for the tragedy.
deng haiping, head of the state mountaineering administration in charge of rescue operations, said six of the tourists had no experience climbing snow-covered mountains and knew little about the terrain.
all six members of the outdoors sports club in xining, qinghai's capital, are persons.
of the three survivors, lu shimin said that the two of them had climbed such mountains for the first time.
deng said they had no compass, altitude measuring apparatus, let alone the special communication equipment usually used on mountains.
he also said that the snow slide was a " bold idea " and that it was the cause of the deadly avalanche.
the accident occurred saturday afternoon when six people slid down 3,700 meters from the high daban mountain in ertanggou township, menyuan hui autonomous county, haibei tibetan autonomous prefecture.
three survivors reported to police who then started rescue operations with help from villagers.
one body was found early sunday morning.
according to the rescue headquarters, one of those listed as missing is in hong kong, but his identity is undefined.
deng said he could take an id card with him and only his mandarin name, hung zhihua, was known and the local government would try to find out his identity with the hong kong special administrative region.
a fifth rescue team has been dispatched to search for the missing person and more than 140 rescuers are now involved in the operation.
deng said despite thick snow and signs of a new avalanche hampering rescue work.
deng said we found no clues but two helmets in the past three days.
officials in los angeles are mulling ways to accommodate katrina evacuees.
los angeles, september 6
los angeles county and city officials tuesday were trying to determine the best way to accommodate at least 2,000 evacuees expected to be brought to the gulf coast after the katrina aftermath.
gloria molina, who supervises los angeles county, said molina and villaraigosa will assemble key members of their administrations over the labor day weekend to assess whether the county and city can host thousands of displaced families who survived the disastrous hurricane.
molina and villaraigosa committed to taking at least 2,000 evacuees.
local officials announced earlier this week that a city/county task force of katrina evacuees has been created in los angeles to assist survivors with immediate and long-term transition.
california state emergency services office, federal government, county and city departments and non-profit organizations such as the red cross coordinate local efforts.
the los angeles county emergency operations center was activated by the county supervisor and mayor to prepare for an intensive response involving assistance to evacuees.
dozens of people have already traveled from louisiana and alabama to los angeles county to the dream center, a non-profit shelter.
a new task force is being prepared to assist with shelter, support services, information and coordination of private sector assistance to find evacuees a more permanent house as soon as possible.
molina and villaraigosa are calling on the private sector and non-profit organizations to help provide the needs of children and families coming from the los angeles area.

in the lake city of udaipur, schools and colleges are definitely closed.
chief minister vasundhara raje said the situation was still grim in the flood-affected areas.
the indo-asian news service quoted the chief minister as saying that the flood situation was slowly improving and that less water was flowing towards the dam where the water was constantly being discharged.
raje said an assessment of losses caused by the floods would be done soon and memorandums would be sent to the indian government seeking assistance for rehabilitation and relief operations.

in a press release on wednesday, the state disaster relief office said that seven bodies of people, including three in renhe township and four in qinlan township, had been found in the debris of collapsed buildings.
all injured villagers were treated at local hospitals.
one of the ten seriously injured was in critical condition, a doctor said.

yichang, hubei, april 20
about 200 people were evacuated sunday night by local authorities, who said they were threatened by a massive ongoing landslide in central china's hubei province.
xingshan county land and resources bureau head du honghui said that 200 people including teachers and residents were evacuated to a middle school in gaoyang city.
the continued rain triggered a landslide of 60,000 cubic meters (80,000 cubic yards) of land.
it was 2,000 cubic meters that caused the rock mud flow to inundate a nearby primary school and a village with 37 homes.
as of 22:00 sunday, the ground floor of the classroom building of gaoyang primary school, a center school, was covered with a meter-deep layer of mud, and the windows, desks and chairs of the classrooms were all damaged.
the playground was inundated with mud between 30 and 50 centimeters.
du said the rescue effort was underway and the situation of the landslides was being closely monitored.

survivors of the cyclone nargis recount the tragedy of the cyclone.
yangon, may 13
survivors of some cyclones who came to yangon from disaster-hit home regions in a hard way seeking shelter after the cyclone nargis aftermath recounted bitter experiences of the recent cyclone nargis that struck their areas on tuesday.
survivors in laputta township in the delta division of ayeyawaddy state in southwestern myanmar who escaped death from the nargis storm with much hardship said they experienced a terrible human tragedy.
survivors from pinzalu village, lying deep in far laputta city, said pinzalu village stood the hardest hit, with the township having total collapse of houses and 20-foot high tide waves caused by cyclone storms.
he said he tried to swim to escape but was carrying his two young daughters and one of them died shortly from the violent storm.
he had no alternative, but he abandoned his dead daughter on the waves and tried to keep afloat for a long time by holding a fallen branch of a nearby tree.
he cried out because another of his daughters had been found dead in his hands after the storm winds had stopped for a moment.
he recalls a tide wave sweeping his parents away at the start of the tragedy and being left to live alone.
he said that many others in his village had been swept away by the storm wave in a similar way, and added that he had walked to laputta afterwards, way after he had witnessed all the houses in his village under water.
he didn't find drinking water and food when he faced hunger, so he tried to survive hunger by drinking coconut juice from fallen coconuts.
another woman villager told local media that she escaped by staying on the roof of her hut but was struck by a fallen bamboo caused by the wind.
the unmovable strike-standers were swept away overnight by the storm.
she said she walked through laputta and saw many dead on the way and estimated that the storm killed three-quarters of her village's people.
she described only five people remaining alive nearby the village of yway ywa.
a teacher from the village of yay wai ywa spoke to the local weekly eleven news and added that most of the dead were females.
she said the whole village cried in the storm because the world was devastated, and some members of the family died together in a series of lying on the road.
she exclaimed, " i did not find any dependable relatives in laputa, but i rested in some spoiled pagoda pavilions with shelters. "
" but some well-wishers have donated millet gruel, she said, " i have to queue for it. "
local doctors are worried about hygiene issues, as the disposal of urine by tens of thousands of homeless victims has developed and also constitutes a health threat to thousands of unsettled dead bodies.

the international atomic energy agency has reached an agreement with iranian officials stating that there are no remaining issues or ambiguities regarding iran's nuclear program and activities.
u.s. and european officials suspect that iran's civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials suspect that iran's civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials could impose a fourth round of sanctions on tehran when the u.n. security council is likely to consider the issue of iran's nuclear energy program in september 2007.
the international atomic energy agency will distribute limited copies of the iaea report before the meeting of 35 board members on 11 september 2007.
the findings reflect the agreement reached between tehran and the agency on 21 august 2007, which iranian officials began publicizing the week of 12 august 2007.
according to the accord, there remain no issue and ambiguity regarding iran's nuclear program and activities.
according to a reuters news agency account, the iaea report says that the steps forward are significant towards a work plan.
a senior u.n. official was quoted by reuters as saying that iran's efforts to enrich uranium were slowing.
according to the iaea report, iranian officials must continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of iran's present and future nuclear program.
iranian officials stated on august 30, 2007 that they would cooperate with the iaea to prevent further rounds of international sanctions.
iran's representative to the iaea ali asghar soltanieh stated to tehran's fars news agency that the report emphasizes that there are no signs or evidence indicating diversion of iran's nuclear activities and that all of iran's nuclear materials have been audited.
some non-proliferation experts state that the iaea has ceded too much to iran.
in a criticism published august 19, 2007, david albright and jacqueline shire of the washington-based institute for science and international security, an arm control expert, wrote that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that iranian officials will provide the iaea with access to key people, facilities and documents needed to verify answers to the iaea's questions.
independent experts stated that iran's latest agreement with the iaea to grant inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of western demands for iran to halt production of highly enriched uranium, which could potentially be used in a nuclear bomb.
u.s. state department spokesman tom casey stated that iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program but that the report may offer some new details or insights into iran's development of the nuclear program.
casey stated that the nuclear program continues to move forward, showing that the iranian regime continues to defy the international community.
most non-proliferation experts in the west state that the agreement of 20070821 contains little that could dissuade policy-makers in washington, london, paris and berlin from moving another round of security council sanctions forward.
experts stated that many of the transparency issues that were reportedly resolved in the agreement of 21 august 2007 should have been previously resolved.
daryl g. kimball, executive director of the washington-based arms control association, a nonpartisan think tank, stated that the agreement addresses the problem of the iranian government's pursuit of enrichment technology and capabilities, which could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material.
kimball stated that the iranian government is designed to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim progress is being made.
iranian officials stated that more sanctions could reduce the possibility of officials collaborating with inspectors.
the security council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on iran, but the penalties demanded by the u.s. are limited because of pressure from china and russia.
soltanieh stated in an interview with iranian state-controlled television that the reports and measurements make any other international organization, including the security council, to make an irrelevant and unjustified intervention.

a document outlining israel's proposal to allow international organizations to transfer nuclear technology to states that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules was distributed to the nuclear suppliers group.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india to engage in nuclear trade.
israeli officials have convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines that would allow international transfers of nuclear technology to states that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
countries that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, including india, israel and pakistan, are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade, including purchases of reactors, uranium fuel or yellowcake.
in march 2007, israel distributed a document outlining its proposals to 45 members of the nuclear suppliers group.
the israeli presentation was made in a paper that does not allow for official denial.
according to the letter from the nsg chairman, the israeli presentation was offered on march 17, 2007 in the context of the nsg's debate on the indian officials' bid for exemption.
only india and israel among the non-signatories are qualified to admit to the nsg according to their proposals.
israel's plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-treaty states in the nuclear field.
one criterion indicates israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state, and says that nuclear trade should be allowed with israel provided that it applies stringent physical protection, control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons, facilities and source materials in its territory, and all special nuclear materials.
the document circulated on capitol hill in september 2007 as the bush administration worked toward an agreement with indian officials.
arms control association executive director daryl kimball stated that the israeli documents may affect the debate over india.
kimball stated --
at the nsg, it is the officials of the two largest and most powerful countries in the world who do not want obstacles to their cooperation.
reaching a consensus on india at the nsg meeting in november 2007 was difficult.
israel's proposal gives some officials reason to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
israel's record following international nuclear rules is good, better than india's.
the bush administration rejected israel's proposal despite the u.s. and israel being tied together.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india to engage in nuclear trade.
the pact is viewed by president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice as an important part of the foreign policy legacy of his administration.
the deal is controversial in india and must be approved by congress.
with the election year delay having the most negative effect on the administration's foreign policy legacy, the delay in winning approval of the india deal could have a negative effect on the administration's foreign policy legacy.
state department spokesman tom casey stated that the u.s. government views the india deal as unique and does not see it as a precedent for any other country, including israel.
israeli embassy spokesman david siegel stated that suggestions that the israeli government was demanding exemptions or linking the effort to any other issue, including the debate over india, were grossly inaccurate.
seigel stated --
the israeli government has never asked the nsg for an exemption for israel from the nsg guidelines on nuclear supplies, nor has it ever made a specific request for israel.
israel is recognized as having fully adhered to the nsg guidelines.
the israeli government urged the nsg to consider adopting a generic multi-tiered approach to the transfer of nuclear technology based on criteria.
some nsg officials previously suggested an approach similar to israel's plan.
the nsg guidelines would be considerably enhanced if they were modified as the israeli officials propose.

international and proliferation.
ahmadinejad announced iran's uranium production capabilities have expanded.
iran refuses to commit to a halt but hints that it may happen in the future.
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in mashhad, northeastern iran on july 26, 2008 that iran will expand its arsenal of centrifuges for producing enriched uranium over 5,000.
ahmadinejad stated for the first time since the april 2008 announcement of an iranian approach to implementing 6000 centrifuges that there would be an expansion.
iran articulated a goal of 50,000 centrifuges operating at enrichment plants near natanz.
the international community has demanded iran halt nuclear material production.
the media reports differ from the number of centrifuges cited by ahmadinejad.
iranian news agencies reported that ahmadinejad stated that iran had 6000 working centrifuges, but subsequently removed the statement from the internet.
another iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to " hundreds of thousands " of centrifuges.
experts discount significance of ahmadinejad's claims because of the absence of information on the functioning of centrifuges.
the number of centrifuges is less important than whether they are operating and efficient, according to a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity in tehran, who said that ahmadinejad's assertions have hindered the resolution of the diplomatic standoff between iran and the west.
new america foundation arms control expert jeffrey g. lewis stated that the new america foundation is aware of iran's goal of assembling 6,000 centrifuges but does not know the status of the machines' operational status.
diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems have hindered iran's enrichment program.
iran repeated its assertion that its nuclear program aims only to produce electricity, as the production of nuclear weapons contradicts islamic principles.
the us, israel, europe and the majority of western arms control experts believe that iran is pursuing the capability to produce a bomb if it decides to do so immediately.
experts stated that it is relatively simple to produce weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material.
ahmadinejad stated that the west is still pursuing the resumption of negotiations after iran's resistance to western demands to halt iran's nuclear activities.
eu foreign policy chief javier solana recently presented iran with two offers.
a package of incentives to cease production of enriched uranium endorsed by the us.
during the six-week freeze for freeze period, iran will not add centrifuges and the west will refrain from promoting a fourth round of economic sanctions against iran to the un security council.
us officials repeated their statement that negotiations can not begin before iran halts all enrichment-related activities that can be verified, but the bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze and dispatched burns to geneva.
iran refused to respond to solana's offer on 080726 at geneva talks attended by us undersecretary of state for political affairs william j. burns.
the talks constituted the highest level of diplomatic contact between the us and iran in nearly 30 years.
solana, burns and the european envoy set a deadline for iran's positive response before initiating new sanctions, including prohibiting the sale of refined petroleum products, vital to iran's economy.
iranian officials refused to commit to stopping the expansion or observing deadlines.
on july 26, 2008, ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that iran could potentially halt the expansion for over six weeks at a higher number of centrifuges than previously expected.
ahmadinejad stated that the west consented to the existing and operating centrifuges of between 5000 and 6000 if the number of centrifuges did not increase.
5,000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if highly enriched.
6,000 centrifuges running continuously could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for one bomb in six months.
in may 2008, the international atomic energy agency stated that iran possessed 3500 operational centrifuges.

diplomatic meetings in paris concluded without agreement on further steps to pressure iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility.
diplomats stated to the media on november 14, 2008 that officials from the united states, europe, russia and china had not reached agreement at a november 13, 2008 meeting in paris on further action to persuade iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility.
highly technical uranium enrichment process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants or fissile material for atomic weapons.
the 13 november 2008 meeting ended without new measures announced.
the french foreign ministry released a statement after the 13 november meeting in which it declared that the international community reaffirmed the importance of the dual-track approach of engaging diplomatically with iran and working towards sanctions.
russia and china resist new sanctions on iran.
russia and china have close political and business ties with iran and do not feel domestic pressure to act against iran.
the united states has no close political or business ties with the islamic republic of iran and feels domestic pressure to act against iran.
russia and china hold veto power over security council decisions.
according to interfax news agency in moscow, russian diplomat sergei ryabkov said at the meeting on november 13 that the parties did not strike a deal on sanctions against iran and that western countries are in favor of sanctions but china and russia are not in support of sanctions.
sergei ryabkov attended the meeting on 13 november 2008.
a report released this week has reported significant progress in iran's heavy water research reactor facility near arak.
the iranian heavy water research reactor near arak could eventually produce plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons.
satellite images published by the institute for science and international security (isis) show significant progress in the construction of the heavy water research reactor (hrr) facility near arak between february 2008 and october 2008.
david albright stated that iran's heavy water research reactor near arak has evaded the notice of the international security community.
david albright stated that satellite images say there has been significant progress at the iranian heavy water research reactor near arak and that the reactor has progressed from a building frame to a large finished facility in the last 1.5 years.
david albright is a former un arms inspector and is the director of the washington, d.c.-based institute for science and international security.
iran states it is pursuing nuclear technology for energy production and research.
the united states and its western allies suspect that iran's nuclear production efforts preceded the creation of nuclear weapons infrastructure.
low grade uranium production is legal under international arms control regulations.
the latest development in iran's nuclear technology shows that the incoming team of barack obama's foreign policy of the united states will face a complex and technical-diplomatic challenge in taking on the task of stopping iran from mastering nuclear technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
the administration of us president george w. bush managed to synchronize us policy with the leaders of the european union, britain, france and germany in the last months when it was in power to press for tougher sanctions against iran and diplomatic action.
the international atomic energy agency is expected to release a report next week that will criticize iran.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) is a un nuclear watchdog agency.
the emergence of a new initiative on the iranian nuclear program at the paris talks on november 13, 2008 did not decrease hopes that another set of united nations security council sanctions would be imposed before the end of president bush's term.
iran continues to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology while maneuvering diplomatically.
some israeli officials stated that they were alarmed by iran's tests this week of two-stage solid-fuel rockets with a range of 1,200 miles.
tel aviv is less than 650 miles from iranian territory.

a highly-secured russian laboratory complex that stores anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria faces losing electricity because it lacks payment to electricity utility mosenergo.
a large repository of deadly pathogens, including anthrax, plague and other bacteria, is threatened by a loss of electricity at a high-security russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of moscow.
recently, officials from the moscow region electricity utility mosenergo arrived at the russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity due to lack of payment.
the russian laboratory complex is a campus of 90 buildings and served as the location of a secret biological weapons program during the soviet era.
an incorrect headline in izvestia stated that a deadly virus from the moscow regional depository threatened moscow.
the virus is not at the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
every kind of deadly bacteria was being studied at the state scientific center of applied microbiology for use in the soviet union's secret biological weapons program.
there is a large repository of viruses in siberia.
russian and western officials stated that the power cutoff at the state scientific center of applied microbiology was unlikely to result in any threat to public health.
russian and western officials stated that there is not enough certainty to know why the loss of power at the state scientific center of applied microbiology posed a public health threat.
general nikolai n. urakov stated by telephone that the state scientific center of applied microbiology has a quite reliable system of protection in emergency.
nikolai n. urakov, longtime director of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the state scientific center of applied microbiology is working with western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedicine manufacturing site.
general nikolai n. urakov stated by telephone that the scientists at the state scientific center of applied microbiology are scared by this threat of sudden electricity shutdown, because of the kind of psychological pressure it puts on them.
general nikolai n. urakov stated by telephone that if the power was shut down at the state scientific center of applied microbiology, scientists would have to destroy all ongoing bacteriology experiments.
general nikolai n. urakov likes the contribution of the united states and western countries of about 6 million us dollars to transform the former bioweapons complex, which will pay another 500,000 us dollars a year to pay electric bills and arrears of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
american scientists working closely with the state scientific center of applied microbiology stated that the russian government is responsible for paying the research institute's electric bill.
western aid to convert one of general nikolai n. urakov's bioweapons laboratories peaked in 1997 when it was learned that iran had offered to purchase research experts from the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
known that the sense of the crisis is orchestrated by russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on western financing to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, in order to increase financing.
american scientist randall lee beatty is working to convert the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity at the state scientific center of applied microbiology is a crisis.
randall lee beatty is the director of the international science and technology center.
general nikolai n. urakov is financed by the international science and technology center, which is approximately half of the budget of the institute to support about 350 russian biowarfare scientists and technicians.
randall lee beatty stated that he knew that the ssacam did not pay its electric bill for 14 months.
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific center of applied microbiology is one of the world's most important locations for archiving dangerous pathogens and is a shame to be destroyed because of non-payment of electricity utilities.
approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the state scientific center of applied microbiology and many of them are stored in liquid nitrogen cryogenic casks isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversized air handling systems all dependent on electricity for function.
the greatest danger is from the shutdown of electric power at the state scientific center of applied microbiology, when defrosting live germs that are currently preserved in a state of freezing.
monterey institute of international studies biological warfare expert raymond zilinskas stated that the main threat to organisms is not the possibility of escape but the cut in power to the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
raymond zilinskas stated that in the worst case, bacteria would be defrosted at -70 degrees and the cleanup afterward would be a real mess because it was not certain that all the bacteria would die.
another example is the confrontation between the electricity utility mosenergo and the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk, where the basic capitalist imperative of enterprise self-sustainment can dangerously clash with the old soviet-science remnants.
the russian national power company cut off electricity at a strategic base where nuclear missiles stand on high alert because of an overdue power bill in 2000.
nuclear missile silos will not lose power.
armed troops marched to the substation and turned the power back on.
united energy systems, a national company, cut power in january and february 2001 at a number of military installations around russia.
the kamchatka military monitoring center, which lost power, is one of the military installations on the peninsula.
in most cases where military installations have had their electricity cut off, electricity has been quickly restored.
investigations often show that the utility and military are at war with each other, forcing the military to spend budget funds on electric power instead of diverting the money to other useful things.
some budget funds are cut at times for building a country residence for the general.

brazil has implemented a law that allows the air force to target drug trafficking aircraft in brazilian airspace.
the us is concerned about liability if a civilian plane is misidentified.
brazil announced the air force will begin shooting down aircraft used in illegal drug trafficking over brazilian airspace.
before an order to shoot down a plane could be issued, the plan required eight precautionary steps.
prior to the policy taking effect in late 2004 october, the publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they needed to file flight plans.
originally approved in 1998, the law permitting such actions was never put into effect by president fernando henrique cardoso from 1995 to 2003.
the united states dissuaded cardoso from signing the decree because of concerns that the accidental downing of a civilian aircraft could expose the brazilian government and companies to lawsuits.
in april 2001, the united states reduced its previous support for operations targeting drug-running aircraft when a peruvian jet shot down a small plane that had been misidentified as a drug carrier and killed a peruvian missionary and her child.
relatives of victims are suing the us government and have won settlements from the us government for providing intelligence and technical support for the operation.
us state department officials stated --
under certain conditions, us law could forbid assistance to countries implementing the shoot-down law.
the us agrees with brazil's assessment that the threat from drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
the us government consulted the brazilian government on provisions of brazilian law.
brazilian defense minister jose viegas stated that brazil has encountered difficulties in securing us support for the plan but recent bilateral talks have led to a certainty that the brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing brazil to commercial sanctions.
brazilian officials expressed hopeful that the us would endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
the us is scheduled to provide brazil with 10.2 million dollars in drug and law enforcement aid in 2004.
former air force chief and current director of the air institute of the estacio de sa university in rio de janeiro, general mauro jose miranda gandra stated that the government has taken a courageous step, but politics can be more than practical because of the restrictions imposed by the brazilian government.
brazilian officials stated that the policy may not apply to aircraft with children on board.
viegas stated that there is a need for limits.
gandra stated that the provision undermines the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug-smuggling aircraft that carry children, thereby introducing the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
viegas stated in an interview in brasilia that the government will use the law more powerfully to dissuade drug traffickers who previously entered brazil's airspace feeling the air force was not a threat.
the deterioration of the public security situation in sao paolo and particularly in rio de janeiro, with an increasingly powerful and violent drug gang, has prompted the government to act.
drug gangs in rio de janeiro have more firepower than the police, have successfully attacked police stations and have forced businesses and schools to close.
in an interview with foreign correspondents in 2003, president luiz inacio lula da silva stated:
national sovereignty and national security are the policy.
some pilots of drug-running aircraft feel so confident of their immunity that they will gesture obscenely at the brazilian air force pilots in pursuit as a retribution.
the question is whether the law is constitutional under brazil's prohibition of the death penalty as a punishment for criminal acts.
some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounts to a de facto execution of drug traffickers, contrary to government claims.
the o estado de sao paolo daily newspaper stated in an editorial for the week of july 18-24, 2004 that extreme measures raise problems of ethics and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefits.
extrajudicially, people are applied penalties by administrative decisions of air force commanders.
these people gain the power of life and death over the crew members and the non-regular fliers.
brazil inaugurated the $ 1.4 billion radar system sivam in 2002 which allows the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive amazon region for the first time.
the system uses american technology.
initially, illegal flights declined 30 percent, but subsequently reaccelerated as traffic was concerned about improved tracking capabilities.
brazil recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003.
some of these flights are innocent violations by ranchers flying between plantations in the amazon.
viegas stated that there has been a significant increase in deliberate violations of brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who apparently realize that the government is incapable of retaliation.
fernandinho beira-mar, the most notorious drug boss in rio de janeiro, was captured in colombia in april 2001, in a gun-for-drugs pipeline involving leftist guerrillas.
the northern amazon corridor of brazil has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
reportedly, one of the most important drug- and gun-smuggling routes for supplying cocaine into europe runs from colombia through suriname across the northern tier of the amazon.
the only country currently with a targeted anti-drug trafficking aircraft policy is colombia.
colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the united states.

venezuela's president's dealings with russia on weapons, curbs on military cooperation with the united states and plans to train as many as 2 million venezuelan civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion have worried venezuela and its domestic critics.
venezuelan president hugo chavez's dealings with russia on weapons, his curbing of military cooperation with russia, and his plans to train as many as 2 million civilians to repel a possible imperialist superpower invasion have worried the united states and chavez's domestic critics, who see the plans as those of a leftist former military officer.
chavez insisted the move was purely defensive and that venezuela's overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect itself from nations that might want to control venezuela.
venezuela is the largest petroleum producer in south america.
domestic chavez opponents scoff at the idea of a us invasion of venezuela and charge that his true intention is to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists to protect against any internal rising and to pose as a military counterweight to us influence in latin america.
fidel castro, the leader of cuba, is a major ally of chavez and the two have grown closer.
chavez's detractors in the us government say that chavez's purchase of arms and indoctrination of civilian militias could have even more trouble as part of a strategy to restructure venezuelan democracy in the image of a militarized socialist style of cuba, fomenting leftist revolution throughout south america.
us military strategists say they are increasingly concerned about the potential for such a revolution to be fomented by radical movements inspired by chavez.
latin america's political mainstream has shifted leftward since the late 1990 s.
the failure of the free market economics is largely responsible for this leftward shift.
leftists elected to lead brazil, argentina, chile, uruguay, ecuador and venezuela.
chavez's home supporters counter that the united states has a long history of open and covert armed intervention in latin america's domestic politics, and say the united states has no right to question venezuela's defense preparations.
venezuelans never asked what the us marines were doing, said carlos roque espinoza leon.
espinoza leon, a chavez supporter, is a specialist in defense in venezuela's national assembly.
espinoza said peru has 500,000 rifles and no one is saying anything.
espinoza said no one complains that colombia is the most militarized country in latin america.
espinoza said the us history is full of aggression in latin america.
espinoza said venezuelans must do whatever is necessary to protect the country.
chavez said in his famous speech that the so-called venezuelan bolivarian revolution was peaceful but armed.
chavez was first elected in 1998 and according to an independent poll by firm datanalisis, his popularity rates at 71 percent.
venezuelan military analyst alberto garrido said chavez is looking to allies in russia, china and iran to promote a multi-polar world that would counter us domination and encourage grass-roots movements in latin america to throw off the influence of us governments.
lorenzo campos, a farmer from anzoategui state in northern venezuela, and a reservist,
campos said venezuelans want the world to know that they are not prepared to attack anyone and that venezuela is a country with a mission of protection.
in may 2005 chavez's government announced details of a deal with a russian firm to purchase 100,000 ak-103 assault rifles each with 30 rounds of ammunition for $ 18.6 million and the transfer of technology to venezuela to manufacture the rifles.
the deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle.
this price is considerably less than the $ 825 - $ 850 price for the same weapon ordered via the us mails.
the venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 helicopters from russia, 10 transport planes from spain and 6 naval craft from russia.
venezuelan officials said the government is negotiating with brazil to buy around 24 air and train support planes.
chavez insisted and even his staunchest military critics here agreed that the purchase was essential to update the military's decades-old weapons, such as the fal rifles from belgium.
retired general fernando ochoa antich said the statement that chavez was engaged in an arms buildup was an exaggeration.
ochoa was defense minister in 1992 during a failed coup by then-lieutenant colonel chavez.
ochoa stated that venezuela has not purchased arms in the past 25 years and that chavez has not bought weapons aggressively or threateningly towards his neighbors.
ochoa said venezuela never bought arms from russia before and suggested chavez bought the arms to become independent of the us.
ochoa was asked why chavez was buying the popular rifle caliber among subversive forces in latin america and stated that his political support for radical leftist moves made him a continental menace.
the us pentagon is openly questioning what chavez is doing with his old fal rifles and whether he can share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in latin america.
the us government has provided no evidence that chavez is arming or funding leftist insurgencies.
according to military analysts and specialists, the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and are not interested in old rifles from belgium or chavez's assistance.
a study published by the us defense intelligence agency in 2003 reported that more than half of the weapons seized from colombian guerrillas between 1998 and 2001 originated in venezuela.
implies that corrupt or sympathetic members of the venezuelan military could be aiding the guerrillas.
the ideological military and civilian reservist training that critics say chavez has in mind could be more distressing to domestic opponents of chavez.
in 2005, chavez called for the so-called revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist the superpower aggressor, and said that the first step would be to train up to 2 million volunteers in the coming years to back up the active duty armed forces.
military analysts estimate venezuela's active duty armed forces number 83,000.
people are creating their own defense units in neighborhoods, state companies and the free university established under chavez, and are reporting directly to the president.
the government insists the reserves support the armed forces and will not act against a possible chavez coup in column 5.
espinoza said the reserves should not be used for shock troops for any political party and that each person would decide which side to be on in a civil war.
general julio ramon quintero viloria is a reserve commander.
in an interview, quintero said the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians in the second half of 2005 at a rate of 20 per weekend and could train 300,000 more in 2006.
quintero said venezuelans don't want any empire's colony and are ready for any possibility.
in june 2005, 100,000 reservists and the venezuelan navy engaged in a massive war game to repel a stronger invading country.
in june 2005, 40 employees of the state oil company participated in a similar exercise with 1,200 soldiers.
chavez's chavista circle here warns of asymmetrical warfare.
asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by us military strategists to describe conflicts between unequal combatants in which the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
the us government has given colombia 3.3 billion dollars in military aid over the past five years.
chavez loyalists fear the us government could instigate a proxy war between venezuela and colombia, in order to oust chavez and control venezuela's oil.
in an interview, a senior us official dismissed the notion that the us government wants to invade venezuela as completely and utterly nonsensical.
chavez's side wishes to make a negative relationship because they calculate politically that mr. chavez will reach power through constant confrontation with the us, officials said.
another trouble for the united states is the development of chavez rolling back military cooperation and joint exercises.
the us military has had a cooperation office at fort venezuela for 50 years.
chavez shut it down in 2004.
five us military trainers and students participating in an exchange program have been ordered to leave the country by april 2005.
analysts say chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
analysts say there is no proof that chavez has used that force to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere.

and proliferation and international.
the north korean government could be preparing to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in june 2007, in the first step toward disabling the reactor by december 2007.
secretary of state condoleezza rice and secretary of state for foreign affairs christopher hill stated on june 18, 2007 that the north korean government could be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in a first step toward disabling it by december 2007.
hill is the head negotiator for the united states in the negotiations over north korea's nuclear weapons program.
hill stated that the stalled effort to dismantle north korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of june 16-17, 2007 when international atomic energy agency inspectors visited pyongyang at the invitation of pyongyang officials to talk about verification and monitoring of the shutdown.
hill stated that the shutdown was anticipated to be a long one following talks with chinese negotiator wu dawei.
hill stated that the shutdown could happen within weeks, but not within months.
the associated press reported from vienna, austria on 18 june 2007 that the iaea stated that a team will visit pyongyang on 24 june 2007 to discuss the manner of inspectors verifying the shutdown.
hill stated that iaea inspectors held talks with pyongyang officials on the sealing of the reactor, including the installation of a television monitoring site.
north korean officials refused to proceed with an agreement to begin decommissioning the yongbyon reactor until the $ 25 million in funds held in a linked account at the macao bank were transferred to north korea.
money was frozen when u.s. officials accused banco delta asia of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of north korea.
on june 14, 2007, the funds were wired to the new york federal reserve bank after months of disagreements over the method of returning the funds.
the fund is supposed to be sent to russia's central bank before the transfer to a north korean government-controlled account at a russian commercial bank.
hill stated that talks on recouping time lost during the financial transfer negotiations would take place with disarmament negotiators from russia, south korea and japan in the week of june 17, 2007.
the timetable for resuming six-nation talks on arms control was also part of the discussions.
under an agreement reached in february 2007, north korean officials pledged to shut down the yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for 50,000 tons of fuel oil shipments.
in the next phase of the agreement, north korean officials will declare all-nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for further 950,000 tons of fuel oil.
hill stated that the next phase of the agreement could be concluded by december 2007.

leading arms control experts criticized a new nuclear activity plan released by iran and the u.n. international atomic energy agency as ineffective and dangerous.
iran and the international atomic energy agency (iaea) of the u.n. released a plan on august 27, 2007 to resolve the issue by december 2007.
the issue has not been resolved in 4 years.
the plan means to allay suspicions about iran's past nuclear activities.
officials at the agency stated that the plan was a breakthrough.
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated on 28 august 2007 at a news conference in tehran --
the investigation into iran's nuclear activities is now close to completion.
none of the other member countries of the international atomic energy agency have cooperated as well as iran has.
iran is the nucleus of the nation.
iran has a nuclear fuel cycle.
iran will not succumb to international pressure to curb its nuclear project.
iran's nuclear project is for peaceful purposes.
the united states and some european nations believe iran's nuclear project is aimed at making nuclear weapons.
several western governments and leading arms control experts stated that iran was attempting to avoid further u.n. security council punishment.
the western governments include the united states and france.
the government and experts believe that iran is attempting to:
arms control process is slow
avoid answering the question of iran's past violations of the treaty.
stated david albright, president of the institute for science and international security,
iran's claims can not be verified.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) does not have access to people, documents or sites.
the organization has lost the right to further question the iaea in the future.
the unusual development sets a bad precedent.
the iaea can be tricked because they are eager to deal.
according to the international atomic energy agency's (iaea) plan...
iran has resolved the question of its past plutonium experiments without explaining how.
stated mark fitzpatrick, senior fellow at the international institute for strategic studies:
the international atomic energy agency's plan is superficial.
the international atomic energy agency's plan drew out negotiations for many months.
the international atomic energy agency's plan could leave iran with an incomplete and misleading answer.
the international institute for strategic studies is located in london.
plutonium is a material that can be used to make nuclear weapons.
the institute for science and international security (isis) is a private research organization located in washington, d.c.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) is based in vienna.

somali pirates who hijacked a ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms are approaching a deal to release the ship.
questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms through the kenyan route and possible clandestine arms deals between kenya and south sudan.
on october 8, 2008, maritime officials and associates of the somali pirates who hijacked the ukrainian freighter on september 25, 2008, carrying a large cargo of arms, stated that the pirates could collect a ransom for the freighter soon.
after difficult negotiations likened by several involved in the bazaar-style haggling, the parties were close to reaching a deal in which pirates would be paid millions of dollars and ships freed.
businessman ahmed omar in xarardheere, somalia stated that pirates had agreed to a ship owner's ransom of approximately 8 million u.s. dollars and that the ship could be freed on or by october 8, 2008.
xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the somali coast.
kenyan maritime officials stated that there is yet to be agreement on critical details.
one such detail involves pirates requesting a guarantee that they will not be arrested or attacked by the current armada of united states warships encircling them.
kenyan maritime officials stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than just financial aspects.
officials stated on october 8, 2008 that progress was being made and that the parties were approaching an agreement.
the pirates initially requested 35 million u.s. dollars and then reduced it to 20 million u.s. dollars.
the pirates have consistently expressed a willingness to negotiate financial figures.
more than 25 ships were hijacked off the coast of somalia in 2008 to be ransomed typically for $ 1 to $ 2 million u.s. dollars.
pirates who boarded a ukrainian ship stated that the ship, its cargo and the 20 sailors on board would be released upon receiving payment in us dollars, with the pirates preferring a $ 100 bill.
the question is the original destination country of the arms that were shipped on board the ukrainian ship.
shortly after the hijacking of the freighter on september 25, 2008, the kenyan government claimed that the weapons were being shipped to the kenyan military.
ships via the main route through kenya's mombasa port.
the weapons included 33 t-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
subsequently, evidence of weapons in kenya's clandestine arms dealing with the separatist regions in southern sudan emerged.
if the pirates did not hijack the ship and did not begin speaking to the media via satellite phone, the deal is most likely to remain a secret.
ukrainian officials are adamant in their denial of any wrongdoing.
oleh belokolos, the ukrainian diplomat in kenya, stated --
ukraine has no plans to supply any armament to the government of south sudan and has no intention of doing so.
all appropriate paperwork was validated.
ukraine will abide by all united nations rules and agreements on arms control.
ukraine inherited an enormous stockpile of weaponry after the collapse of the soviet union and now has major arms deals.
kenya's dealings with ukraine are considered suspicious because kenya relies mostly on the united kingdom and other western countries for heavy weapons supplies.
kenyan politicians are demanding answers and calling on several commissions to examine the situation.
southern sudan is an autonomous region, currently increasing its military, using soviet-designed tanks.
the us military stated that it would prioritize ensuring that the ship did not unload weapons and that the weapons would not be sold to islamist insurgents in somalia.
pirates denied having any interest in weapons and claimed they were unaware that tanks were among the cargo when they hijacked the ship.
pirate spokesman sugule ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates are solely interested in the money from the deal.

afghanistan produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of insurgency financing, u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said.
afghanistan produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of insurgent financing, u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said.
costa said this to reporters last week as the u.n. drug office prepared to release its latest survey of afghanistan's opium crop.
the survey showed that poppy cultivation has retreated much in afghanistan and is overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of the 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strongest, mostly in the southern provinces.
the survey was issued on november 27, 2008.
the united nations found that the amount of land devoted to opium in afghanistan was reduced by 19 percent despite a total drop in opium production of just 6 percent.
the study stated that high output rates were attributed to a good growing season in the south.
the southern region is an area of heavy irrigation where the taliban maintain a strong presence in 5 provinces and systematically encourage opium cultivation to finance their insurgency for several years.
the u.n. estimates insurgents made much of the $ 300 million in opium trade last year.
costa said a lot of the war effort could be funded between $ 20 million and $ 300 million.
the taliban produced an amount of opium that far exceeded world demand due to three successive bumper crop years.
costa said the result was a glut that depressed prices, which dropped approximately 20 percent.
costa said evidence that prices have not already collapsed and that opium is being stockpiled by the taliban, drug lords and even some farmers, is evidence that opium is being stockpiled.
there is also an increasing amount of processing in afghanistan.
costa added that insurgents were holding a significant amount of opium.
costa said the surplus was as much as 11,000 tons (24 million pounds) -- the equivalent of more than twice the world's three-year demand -- and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
the united nations found that afghanistan produced 8,500 tons of opium in 2008.
world demand is estimated at about 4400 tons per year.
the taliban stood passively by this year's cultivation and lessened pressure on afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
then this supports the current price.
costa, a 6-year veteran of the u.n. office on drugs and crime, is an italian diplomat.

the oriental daily news opined that the hong kong police's recent efforts to cut down five so-called leaders of triad branches or " district team leaders " within three weeks of a short period of time demonstrated the police's determination to eradicate criminal activities.
hong kong police recently worked closely with the public security bureau of guangdong province for intelligence exchange and carried out a series of raids and operations.
hong kong police cracked down on triad activities including drug trafficking, illegal possession of arms, theft, burglary, robbery, selling pirated and obscene recordings, and smuggling of dutiable cigarettes from 18 july to 24 july 2002.
a report stated that on 24 july 2002 police dispatched over 100 staff to storm a propitiatory dance and wine party organized at a disco nightclub in mongkok, kowloon to settle some disputes between two triad groups.
eventually, police arrested three branch leaders and 14 core triad members.
xinhua news agency, july 25, 2002 confirmed by police sources that all 17 people arrested are still under questioning.
according to hong kong police sources, the operation was a success, netting all 17 people, the result of police infiltration into relevant gangs here.
police sources also intimated that more police crackdowns on other triad gangs would follow.
police cooperation between police in the mainland of china and police in other regions is an active police effort of hong kong police to fight off criminal organized persons.
the first so-called target conference of the international drug enforcement conference in the far east was held in hong kong earlier in 20020700.
hong kong was chosen to host the event following the decision made at the idec meeting held in bolivia in february 2002.
there are some 42 anti-narcotics officers from the mainland of china, hong kong, australia, indonesia, japan, south korea, myanmar, the philippines, singapore, thailand and the united states who are senior officers meeting.
a hong kong police internal news letter recently reported that the aim of the conference is to provide a forward-thinking flexible environment for information sharing and positive action against transnational drug trafficking criminals.
the exchange of intelligence between hong kong police and police on the mainland of china is particularly intense.
a delegation of 11 members from the national narcotics control commission of the mainland of china recently visited hong kong to study how the police here enforce their anti-narcotics laws.
deputy director of the bureau of narcotics control of the ministry of public security of the chinese government, chen cunyi, chaired a team of 11 people, briefed by the hong kong police on enforcement actions carried out in hong kong, and led by ip lau chuen, head of the hong kong narcotics bureau.

a document signed by a former high-ranking peruvian army officer and disclosed july 25, 2002, mentions links between drug trafficking and mentions that the document could further compromise the situation of former head of the country's national intelligence service vladimiro montesinos.

the alto huallaga region is located northeast of the capital lima.
the story is based on the final report from the attorney general's office.
the attorney general's office collected the accusatory documents handed over by an unnamed peruvian army general.
according to el comercio newspaper, the scorpion intelligence operation put into effect by then president alberto fujimori in 1992 to fight off terrorism and drug trafficking in the amazon region.

montesinos was a close adviser to former peruvian president alberto fujimori.
fujimori resigned in november over a bribery scandal and is now imprisoned in lima on alleged connections to the scandal.

french foreign minister characterized recent raids on the people's mujahedeen in paris as part of the fight against terrorism.
french foreign minister dominique de villepin said on june 3, 2003 that the french government was considering cracking down on the iranian armed opposition group the people's mujahedeen as part of anti-terrorism operations.
de villepin said on french radio france info that the people's mujahedeen claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in iran and that the dimensions of this terrorism can not be hidden.
de villepin said the justice system would decide on the arrest and that diplomatic factors were not a factor in this affair.
de villepin said the french acted strictly on the basis of justice in determining to try all to fight terrorism.
on 22 june 2003, french police raided the headquarters of the people's mujahedeen in paris' northwestern suburbs.
the people's mujahedeen accused the french authorities of being part of a deal with the iranian government to carry out operations.
the iranian government has denied these claims.
the judiciary is now investigating 17 members of the mujahedeen for alleged links to terrorist organizations and funding terrorist activities.
some 160 people were initially detained as police cracked down on over ten locations of the people's mujahedeen of iran in france.
during the police raid, a paris map with outlined streets related to the us embassy, a bullet-proof jacket, transmission equipment, more than 200 computers and about 9 million cfa (12 million dollars) in cash were seized.
the united states, european union and iran classified the people's mujahedeen as a terrorist organization.
the people's mujahedeen was formed in the 1960 s by young iranian college educated people and is described as a leftist islamist organization.
the people's mujahedeen staged terrorist attacks inside iran in the 1970 s and killed several us military personnel and civilians working on defense projects in teheran.
the people's mujahedeen was part of a broad coalition that initially supported the iranian revolution and participated in the 1979 takeover of the us embassy in teheran.
the fallout from the people's mujahedeen and the government has been that since the 1980 s the people's mujahedeen has built military bases in iraq and political bases in europe.
the people's mujahedeen has claimed responsibility for several assassinations of iranian regime officials in recent years.
these assassinations include the assassination of assodalah ladjevardi, former director of the evin prison in teheran in august 1998, and the assassination of ali sayad chirazi, a former iranian army chief of staff and general, in april 1999.
