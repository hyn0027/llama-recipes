support the person who started the thread resolutely, i will reply with a poem composed.
pledge to fight to the death to defend the diaoyu islands and related islands.
the fishing boats were bumped up in the fleet, the little japanese ghosts stirred up trouble and unrest, they showed their wolfish appearance again with the heart of a thief and the arrogance of a form.
don't go back to that time when we appeared to be humiliatingly signing the treaty, china is strong, the sword must be sharp, the knife must be shiny, we must bury the approaching enemy.

i agree with the analysis of the person who started the thread. if a real war comes, i like to be named hua mulan to protect our home and defend our homeland, to spread the prestige of our china, and to pledge to fight to the death to defend our national dignity.
i wish i could bear that passionate upsurge long march of mao zedong to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all enemies of china and spread our dragon's prestige.
how long will we tolerate japan?
i say to my fellow citizens.
hello everyone, as we all know, japan is now planning another premeditated incident at sea, similar to the lugou bridge incident, in order to repeat the september 18 th incident.
japan has surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world and has openly invaded our sacred territory, the diaoyu islands.
the diaoyu islands have always belonged to china, we all know that, but because of historical reasons, what belongs to us originally has become controversial.
fellow citizens, i say we are what we are and why the need for negotiation? japan has gone even further, so they want to create the fact of occupation. can we allow this? absolutely not!
i say to my fellow citizens that japan's militarism brought grave disasters to the asian people.
china has suffered from japan's ravages for several decades long.
snt1 ( japanese unit 731 experimented on chinese, korean and other people with extremely brutal methods on human bodies in northeast, adding a layer of blood that will never fade away with the nanjing massacre; snt2 the bloody and big battle in hengyang and changsha barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely bare
fellow citizens, i have said too many instances of heinous crimes committed by japan in china that are difficult to record without exhausting all the bamboo strips.
just like those millions of deceased souls that lost their lives, wandering over the pacific ocean and finding it difficult to rest in peace.
still, all those who experienced that era will remember it vividly, and even our younger generation will cry tears down our cheeks, and our blood will boil with indignation, whenever we turn the page of this historical page and read it.
actually, it is japan's now wanting to reverse the verdict on its aggressive history that has woken up fellow citizens and chinese in asia.
we have to go forward, despite the pain of looking back at this shameful 100 years, but we have to create history and choose history, even if the historical issues are not resolved.
responsible is the reason we are not afraid, the territory is small but it relates to the matter of dignity, the honor is guaranteed regardless of how the wind and cloud change, we cannot let our native land be separated despite the scars.
i say to my fellow citizens that the advent of the 21 st century means that china is facing many challenges and that we are at a time when we are beset with difficulties inside and are being pressed from outside.
how should we go about dealing with taiwan, tibet, the south china sea, the surrounding environment and the aggressive foreign forces of china?
fellow citizens, i say do. look at the world map and you will see that the crescent encirclement is suppressing our breath, strangling our development and coveting our national territory.
we never feared the people, we never wanted to make our enemies, we are not afraid of war, we do not want war.
we must urgently arrange our armed forces and strengthen all our military forces on land, at sea and in the air.
china has flourished several times over the past thousands of years, but never has it had the ambition to expand its territory outward.
we do not impose on others what we do not want, so we follow a foreign security strategy philosophy of benevolence and virtue.
like the country's tolerance and liberalness, it is individual's tolerance and liberalness, which means we have to insist that we will not hurt others, but avoid hurting ourselves.
tolerance is not certain fear, and sincerity is not obligatory cowardice.
china's exemption of japan from war repair caused by world war ii serves the peace of benevolence.
i say to my fellow citizens, the people's heroes monument is a condensed history of china's nation that is striving for continued improvement.
solemn and magnificent postures represent sacred expectations of peace.
my memory string is occasionally agitated by the many heroic and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses that spring up in my mind.
my thoughts went from that yellow history page to that kangxi emperor who, alone in his audience hall, contemplated how he achieved unifying the territory, and who, generations later, was a famous emperor and ruler of the u.s. also wandering alone in the dark great hall, thinking of the integrity of the union.
snt/1 while the world is peaceful, it is certainly dangerous to forget the war; snt/2 i say to my fellow citizens, we must never exercise forbearance blindly, we want development and peace; snt/3 in modern times, the boxer protocol, which is a betrayal and humiliation of the nation, has aggravated china's poverty and backwardness; snt/4 falling behind is the bully's leader.
how will peace come if there is no strength?
we must focus on national defense education, build up the great wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people, and establish a full-range, capable national defense system to defend the nation.
(s1) the best defense is offensive, we should strengthen our force that can engage in an attack of the utmost range and improve our deep and great combat capability in all aerospace; (s2) you must increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment, establish a high-tech elite division of high quality, all premised on avoiding the influence of national economic development; (s3) and you must increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment, establish a high-tech elite division of high quality, all premised on avoiding the influence of national economic development.
the battle horns are about to sound, people are already fully equipped and ready to go.
without the support of the people, we accomplish nothing, but with their support, we are all powerful.
i say to my fellow citizens, time has come when we must come together and say no to other people. we must achieve.
the guarantee fund was established, the working environment and working mechanism were improved, and hundreds of thousands of information technology professionals who emigrated to the united states and around the world were recruited back to china.
2. a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were created.
3. manufacture 5,000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds.
4. accelerate research and deployment of high-speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles that could break missile defense systems.
5. resume nuclear experiments and establish military forces in space.
6 ) retain 1,000 nuclear bombs the equivalent of 10 million tons of trinitrotoluene (tnt) and install all short and medium range missile warheads when needed.
(7) 30 nuclear-powered strategic submarines capable of inflicting 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy will be retained.
8. you have abandoned the first use of nuclear weapons.
9. retain the right to preemptive strikes when national security is threatened.
fellow citizens, i am confident and i am improving, we can only strive to be strong if we are confident and improve. qin shi huang unified china, zheng chenggong recovered taiwan, we must carry on the far-sightedness, insight and strong will of our predecessors.
fellow citizens, now that piece of land that trembles far from motherland and moans and calls is shaking and trembling, let's carry forward what the previous generations wished for but was not fulfilled, let's move forward courageously and make it happen.
reading history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmered into my concern for the nation. i willingly serve our motherland as a volunteer to make her prosper and be splendid once again. even if i die, i have no regrets. i am willing to bear the cloth gown and be included in the common people. my sincere and patriotic heart is adequate to show to heaven.
i composed this poem here in the classical form of ci to voice the aspirations of my heart.
paint your lips a deep red.
protect the diaoyu islands.
we lost our ryukyu islands bitterly.
how can we allow diaoyu islands to fall into other countries?
100 years of vicissitude.
the smoke and cloud chased the flying wave.
the youngest brother was still tender in youth.
all directions wandered and the seals bore.
flagged for a look over.
we brandished our weapons and crossed east.
let the horses drink from the pacific ocean.

so why aren't we fighting the little japan?
what do the chinese tolerate still?
they even ride on our heads.
do the chinese gut still do this?
we should tell the whole world that china cannot bully other countries at will.
it's time we showed our strength, china has been too calm for too long.
our citizens' lives are all too carefree currently, officials are too extravagant.
we have no cohesion now already, china needs to start a war, the face of the countries following the us rear is being slapped harshly.
let them know the us is not a panacea, if we win, china's influence can be increased, and the cohesion of the citizens can be improved, if we lose, we can clean out incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out, let china have new blood and update, get china up.
go china!
i suggest that china strengthen the guard of the diaoyu islands, guard them every day, and protect the fishermen and our sovereignty. if japan dares to invade our territory by military force, we will fight a small scale war to defend ourselves regardless of the cost. china cannot lose.
we need to show in life, but really, when you show you are someone's embrace, p.
i just passed by.
this is like the whole society including stars.
damn, not sexy.
it is totally unacceptable.
just a cheap entertainer, they have some sense of reputation in feudal china.
their lives were glorious.
the group consisted of nine professionals.
life is hard
shocked
that's normal, and whores are always heartless and the performers are never righteous.
they want money, not face.
look for the wolf near ms. fan with glasses, you know the actor has to drink with him or he will not be forced out or even framed.
son of a bitch
as long as there's something lovely to eat.
no one is easy, the live show is like a show, you have to look at the script to know how to perform.
all somebody
all his life, he walked 360 times, and behind the top imperial examination scorer, there was so much effort and endeavor, this humiliated the words " bean vermicelli ".
haha:
overdo
reality
shoot that hooligan.
cheap performers.
cheap performers.
the entertainment circle is dirty, all the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
those stars are not easy, pity them, but who is to blame?
everybody does this, how can you make money if you don't?
when the woman is in front of other people, she is proud, but when she is alone, she is melancholy.
nowadays, stars are just as popular as prostitutes in ancient times. they are famous now, so it's just normal for them to drink or even sleep with some high officials.
stop talking to other people, just behave.
what should we do in the future? it's not enough to be able to succeed alone, are we also facing such hard choices?
the more suffering, the glorious the look, which is undisputable.
it's not so bad because they're just playing in their own circle, out of sight, out of mind.
but the old guy zhang jizhong, who behaved hooliganishly in his circle and also thought that he was virtuous because he had no talent, made a tv series when he had nothing to do to wreck the people of the whole country.
both took what they needed.
when will china have a pure and innocent girl?
now the story is very shocking in the entertainment world. rumor has it that hsu yuki was forced out because he refused to drink with the arranged company guests and was instead obliged to switch to working as a lawyer's assistant to make an end meeting.
superstars often encounter social encounters or circumstances they are not welcome to but have to join in.
the reason they cann't decide on many things after all is because the decision has to do with many aspects and the interests of many people.
sometimes it is not so simple that a dinner party for a star seems like we imagine it to be, that it is not that different from a normal dinner party that we would have for an ordinary person.
stars have lots of contracts and if they tackle well their sources of money will roll in, if she doesn't tackle well then she will come out of the heels or even in a frame.
there are two kinds of stars and smart female stars:
the second kind of person is good at playing tricks and achieving his objectives with his own seed money.
even some super star female will win their first role this way.
after some drinks, the advertiser or sponsor may chance to lie on the star's shoulder, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, and the star adopts an enduring attitude.
they are very from the 9 lower professions.
those stars are just pretending, and actually living a damn good life, much better than this.
entertainers are just cheap, so i agree. their reputation in feudal china is somewhat sensable.
agrees.
oh well, the actors aren't easy to deal with.
they deserve it, they asked for it.
nothing is easy for me, i'm a dawn.
women are birds and beasts, and men are more birds than beasts.

international; weapons; politics; proliferation; energy
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) has reached agreement with iranian officials stating that there are no remaining issues or ambiguities regarding iran's nuclear program and activities.
u.s. and european officials suspect the iranian civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used in the production of atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials suspect the iranian civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials are possible to impose a fourth round of sanctions on tehran when the u.n. security council is likely to consider the issue of iran's nuclear program in september 2007.
the international atomic energy agency distributed limited copies of a publication copying the iaea's reports before the 35 members of the iaea's board met on september 11, 2007.
the findings reflect the agreement reached between tehran and the european union on 21 august 2007, which was publicized by iranian officials beginning the week of 12 august 2007.
the accord says that the issue and ambiguity regarding iran's nuclear program and activities will remain.
a reuters news account said the iaea report said the step was a significant step forward in the work plan.
a senior u.n. official was quoted by reuters as saying that iran's efforts to enrich uranium were slow.
the iaea report states that iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of iran's present and future nuclear programs.
iranian officials stated on august 30, 2007 that iranian officials were cooperating with the iaea in order to prevent further rounds of international sanctions.
iran's representative to the iaea, ali asghar soltanieh, was quoted by the fars news agency in tehran as saying that the report emphasizes that there is no sign or evidence indicating that iran's nuclear activities have been diverted and that all of iran's nuclear material has been audited.
some non-proliferation experts stated that the iaea has ceded too much to iran.
in a criticism published 19 august 2007, david albright of the washington-based institute for science and international security and jacqueline shire of the institute for science and international security wrote that the idea of closing the files violates fundamental safeguards and that the agreement does not specify that iranian officials will provide the iaea with access to key people, facilities and documents needed to verify the iaea's answers to its questions.
independent experts stated that iran's agreement with the iaea to allow inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information was the shortest it could be given western demands for iran to halt production of highly enriched uranium which could be used in a potential nuclear bomb.
u.s. state department spokesman tom casey stated that iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program but the report may offer some new details or insights into the development of the program.
casey stated that the nuclear program is moving forward and shows that the iranian regime is continuing to defy the international community.
most western non-proliferation experts stated that the 20070821 agreement contained little that would dissuade policymakers in washington, london, paris and berlin from moving around another round of security council sanctions.
experts stated that many of the issues of transparency that were resolved in the 20070821 agreement should have been resolved previously.
daryl g. kimball, executive director of the arms control association, a washington, d.c.-based think tank that is non-partisan, stated that the agreement addresses the problem of iran's pursuit of enrichment technology and capabilities that could lead to the production of nuclear material for a bomb.
kimball stated that the iranian government is designing to deflect criticism and pressure and claim progress.
iranian officials stated that sanctions could be reduced if the inspectors collaborated with officials.
the security council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on iran, but the penalties were limited because of pressure from china and russia.
soltanieh stated in an interview with iranian state-controlled television that the report and the measures made any other international organization irrelevant and unjustified in intervening.

israel (il)
proliferation; technology; international; politics
the israeli proposal to allow international nuclear technology transfers to non-proliferation rule signatories was distributed to the nuclear suppliers group.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india from nuclear trade restrictions.
israeli officials have convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines that would allow international transfers of nuclear technology to states that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
countries that are not signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (india, israel, pakistan) will be prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade, including purchases of reactors, uranium fuel, or yellowcake.
in march 2007 the israeli proposal outline was distributed to the 45 members of the nuclear suppliers group.
the israeli presentation was not made on a paper that would allow for an official denial.
the letter from the nsg chairman said that israel's presentation would be offered in the context of the nsg's debate over the indian officials' bid for exemption on march 17, 2007.
only india and israel among non-treaty signatories would qualify to be admitted to the nsg on the basis of the proposal of those countries.
israel's plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-treaty states in the nuclear field.
one criterion indicates israel's status as a non-declared nuclear weapons state and says that israel should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if it applies stringent physical protection, control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons, facilities and material in its territory, all nuclear source materials and special nuclear materials in its territory.
the document circulated in the capitol hill in september 2007 as the bush administration worked toward an agreement with the indian officials.
arms control association executive director daryl kimball stated that the israeli document could affect the debate in india.
kimball stated --
at the nsg, officials from the largest and most powerful countries, india and the united states, were not wanting to obstacles to india and the united states being the largest and most powerful countries.
reaching a consensus on india at the nsg meeting in november 2007 will be difficult.
israeli proposals gave some officials reason to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
israel's record following international nuclear rules is good and better than india's.
the bush administration has rejected israeli proposals, despite israel's ties to the u.s. government.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india from nuclear trade sanctions.
president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice view the pact as an important part of the administration's foreign policy legacy.
the deal has been controversial in india and will have to be approved by congress.
the delay in the india deal approval win could negatively affect the administration's foreign policy legacy with the most negative effect being the delay in the election year.
state department spokesman tom casey stated that the u.s. government views the india deal as unique and does not see it as a precedent for any other country, including israel.
israeli embassy spokesman david siegel said the suggestion that the israeli government demand exemptions or link the effort to any other issue, including the indian debate, is grossly inaccurate.
seigel stated --
the israeli government has never asked the nsg for an exemption from the nsgs guidelines on nuclear supplies, and has never made a specific request for israel.
israel has fully fledge recognition of the nsg guidelines.
the israeli government urged the nsg to consider adopting a generic, tiered approach to the transfer of nuclear technology based on criteria.
some nsg officials previously suggested an approach similar to israel's plan.
the non-nuclear proliferation regime would be considerably enhanced if the ngsl guidelines were modified along the lines proposed by israeli officials.

iran (ir)
international; proliferation
ahmadinejad announced that iran's capability to produce uranium has been expanded.
iran refuses to commit to a halt in expansion but has hinted that a halt could be in the future.
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashhad on july 26, 2008 that iran has expanded its centrifuge arsenal to over 5,000.
ahmadinejad stated that the first expansion since the april 2008 announcement that iran was approaching implementation of 6000 centrifuges.
iran has articulated a goal of 50,000 centrifuges operating at an enrichment plant near natanz.
the international community demands that iran halt nuclear material production.
the media reports differ from the number of centrifuges cited by ahmadinejad.
iranian news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated that iran has 6000 working centrifuges but subsequently removed the statement from the internet.
another iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100,000 centrifuges.
experts discount the significance of ahmadinejad's claims because there is no information on the functionality of the centrifuges.
western diplomats speaking anonymously in tehran said the number of centrifuges was less important than whether the machines operated and were efficient, but assertions by ahmadinejad have hindered resolution of the diplomatic standoff between iran and the west.
new america foundation arms control expert jeffrey g. lewis stated that the think tank is aware of iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but does not know the status of the machines' operational status.
diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems hinder iran's enrichment program.
iran repeated its assertion that its nuclear program is aimed only at producing electricity because producing nuclear weapons contradicts islamic principles.
the us, israel, europe and the majority of western arms control experts believe that iran is pursuing the capability to produce a bomb immediately if it decides to do so.
experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor grade material is relatively simple.
ahmadinejad stated that the west is still pursuing the resumption of negotiations after iran resisted western demands to halt its nuclear activities.
eu foreign policy chief javier solana recently presented the two offers to iran.
a package consisting of incentives to cease production of enriched uranium which is endorsed by the us.
for six weeks during the freeze, iran was not adding centrifuges and the west refrained from promoting a fourth round of economic sanctions against iran at the un security council.
us officials have repeated that negotiations cannot begin before iran halts all enrichment-related activities that can be verified, but the bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze and dispatched burns to geneva.
iran refused to respond to the offer made by solana on 080726 during talks in geneva attended by us undersecretary of state for foreign affairs william j. burns.
the talks constituted the highest level of diplomatic contact between the us and iran in nearly 30 years.
solana, burns and the european envoy set a deadline for iran's positive response before solana and burns initiated new sanctions including a prohibition on selling iran's vital refined petroleum products.
iranian officials refused to commit to stopping the expansion or observing deadlines.
ahmadinejad appeared on 26 july 2008 to suggest that iran could potentially halt the expansion at a higher number of centrifuges than previously expected over a period of six weeks.
ahmadinejad stated that the west consented to the existence and operation of between 5000 and 6000 centrifuges if the number of centrifuges is not increased.
if the material is highly enriched, 5,000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear material to make a power plant or an atomic bomb.
6000 centrifuges running continuously could produce weapons-grade uranium in 6 months.
in 20080500 the international atomic energy agency stated that iran possessed 3500 operational centrifuges.

the paris diplomatic meeting concluded that further steps to pressure iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility would not be agreed.
on 14 november 2008 diplomats stated to media that at a meeting on 13 november 2008 in paris united states officials, european officials, russian officials and chinese officials had not reached agreement to take further action to persuade iran to halt uranium enrichment at its facility in natanz.
the highly technical process of uranium enrichment is capable of producing fuel for nuclear power plants and fissile material for atomic weapons.
the meeting on november 13, 2008 ended without new measures or announcements.
the french foreign ministry released a statement on 13 november 2008 stating that after the 13 november 2008 meeting the dual-track approach to engaging iran diplomatically and working towards sanctions is reaffirmed as an important international community declaration.
russia and china resisted new sanctions against iran.
russia and china are closely tied to iran politically and economically and do not feel domestic pressure to act against iran.
the united states is not close tied politically and economically with iran and feels domestic pressure to act against iran.
russia and china hold veto power over security council decisions.
russian diplomat sergei ryabkov was quoted by interfax news agency in moscow as saying that at a meeting on november 13, 2008 russia will not strike a deal on iranian sanctions and that western countries favor the sanctions but china and other countries do not support them.
sergei ryabkov attended the meeting on november 13, 2008.
a weekly report released this week stated that iran has made significant progress in the construction of the heavy water reactor research facility near the city of arak.
the heavy water iranian research reactor near arak may eventually be able to produce plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons.
satellite images published by the institute for science and international security showed significant progress in the construction of the heavy water research reactor near arak from february 2008 to october 2008.
david albright stated that the heavy water reactor near the iranian city of arak has evaded notice from the international security community.
david albright said the satellite images said the iranian heavy water research reactor near arak was making significant progress and that the reactor was 1.5 years into building a frame and was on its way to becoming a large finished facility.
david albright was a former arms inspector and is the director of the washington d.c.-based institute for science and international security.
iran stated that it is pursuing nuclear technology for energy production and research.
the united states and its western allies suspect that iran will precede its nuclear production efforts with the creation of nuclear weapons infrastructure.
under international arms control regulations, the production of low-grade uranium is legal.
the technical and diplomatic challenge facing the incoming barack obama's united states foreign policy team is to take on the task of stopping iran from mastering the technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons, given that iran is developing nuclear technology at the latest.
in the last month in power, the administration of us president george w. bush has managed to synchronize us policy with the leaders of the european union, great britain, france and germany to press for tougher sanctions against iran and diplomatic action.
the international atomic energy agency is expected to release a report next week criticizing iran.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) is a nuclear watchdog and a united nations organization.
the lack of new initiatives on iran's nuclear program at paris talks on 13 november 2008 caused hopes of imposing another set of united nations security council sanctions before the end of president bush's term to decrease.
iran continues to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology while maneuvering diplomatically.
some israeli officials said they were alarmed by iran's recent test-firing of a two-stage solid-fuel rocket with a range of 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers).
tel aviv is less than 650 miles from iranian territory.

the russian high - security laboratory complex that stores anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria faced a loss of electricity because it lacked payment to the electricity utility mosenergo.
a large repository of deadly pathogens, including anthrax, plague and other killers, stored in a highly secure russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of moscow, is threatened by loss of electricity.
recently, officials from moscow region's electricity utility mosenergo arrived at a russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity because of a lack of payment.
the russian laboratory complex consists of 90 buildings and served as the location of the soviet union's secret biological weapons program.
incorrect headlines in the izvestia newspaper stated that the killer virus threatens the city of moscow from the region's depository.
the virus is at the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
every kind of bacterium being studied for use in soviet union's secret biological weapons program was located at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the virus repository is located in siberia.
russian and western officials stated that the power cuts at the state scientific center of applied microbiology are unlikely to result in any threat to public health.
russian and western officials stated that there was not enough certainty to know why power was lost at the state scientific center of applied microbiology and that it was therefore impossible to know why the public health threat occurred.
nikolai urakov, the general, said by telephone that the state scientific center of applied microbiology has a system that can be relied on in an emergency.
nikolai urakov, a retired general, has long been the director of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the state scientific and applied microbiology center is working with western scientists to convert the site into a biomedicine manufacturing site.
nikolai urakov, a general, said by telephone that the scientists at the state scientific center of applied microbiology were scared by this threat of sudden electricity shutdown, which he said was a kind of psychological pressure.
nikolai urakov, a general, said by telephone that scientists would have to destroy all ongoing bacteriological experiments if power was shut down at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
like general nikolai urakov said, the united states and western countries have contributed about 60 million dollars to transform the former bioweapons complex and another 5 million dollars a year to pay the electric bills and arrears of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
american scientists working at the closely-linked state scientific center of applied microbiology stated that the russian government is responsible for paying the research institute's electric bills.
1997 peak of western aid to convert one of gen. nikolai urakov's bioweapons laboratories because iran offered to purchase research institute experts from the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the crisis is being orchestrated by russian scientists and military leaders who depend on western financing to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the sense of crisis is being increased to increase financing.
american scientist randall lee beatty worked to convert the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity at the state scientific and applied microbiology center is a crisis.
randall lee beatty is the director of the international science and technology center.
half of general nikolai urakov's budget for supporting about 350 russian biowarfare scientists and technicians was financed by the international science and technology center.
randall lee beatty stated that the ssca m had not paid its electricity bill for 14 months.
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific center of applied microbiology is one of the most important locations in the world for archiving dangerous pathogens and that it is a shame that the location was destroyed due to lack of electricity payments.
approximately 3000 strains of the bacterium are stored at the state scientific center of applied microbiology and many others are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment in all-layered enclosures and oversized air-handling systems that depend on electricity for function.
defrosting frozen live germs is the greatest danger from a power shutdown at the state scientific and applied microbiology center.
raymond zilinskas, a biological warfare expert at the monterey institute of international studies, said the main threat is that the power of the state scientific center of applied microbiology has been cut instead of the threat of the possibility of the organisms escaping.
raymond zilinskas stated that if the worst case scenario occurs, the bacteria would be defrosted at minus 70 degrees and the clean up afterwards would be a real mess because it is not certain that all the bacteria would die.
another example is mosenergo electricity utility confronting the obolensk state scientific center of applied microbiology, which shows that the basic capitalist imperative of enterprise self-sustainability can be dangerously clashed with the old things remaining from soviet union weapon science.
the russian national power company cut off electricity at a strategic base where nuclear missiles are on high alert because the power bill was overdue in 2000.
missile silos will not lose power.
the troops turned the power back on and marched to the substation.
united energy systems, a national company, cut power at a number of military installations around russia in january and february 2001.
the kamchatka center that monitors the russian space forces includes installations that have lost power.
electricity was quickly restored in most cases where military installations had cut off power.
the investigation showed that the utility and military tug of war often forces the military to spend budget funds on electricity power instead of diverting the money to other useful things.
some budget cuts have included funding for building residences in the country for generals.

brazil has implemented a law allowing the air force to target drug aircraft in brazil's airspace.
the us is concerned about liability if a civilian plane is misidentified.
brazil announced that the air force would begin shooting down aircraft used to traffic in illegal drugs in brazil's airspace.
before the order to shoot down the plane could be issued, the plan required eight precautionary steps.
prior to the policy taking effect in late october 2004, the publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they needed to file a fly plan.
the law permitting such actions was originally approved in 1998, but president fernando henrique cardoso never put the policy into effect.
the united states dissuaded cardoso from signing the decree because of the united states' concern that the accidental downing of a civilian aircraft could expose the government and companies to lawsuits.
in april 2001 the united states reduced its support for operations targeting drug-running aircraft after a peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed a peruvian missionary and her child.
the relatives of the victims sued the us government and won a settlement from them for providing intelligence and technical support for the operation.
a state department official stated that --
under certain conditions, us law could forbid assistance to countries implementing the shoot-down law.
the us agrees with brazil's assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
the us government consulted the brazilian government on provisions in brazilian law.
brazilian defense minister jose viegas stated that brazil has encountered difficulties in securing us support for the plan but that recent bilateral talks have led to certainty that the brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing brazil to commercial sanctions.
brazilian officials expressed hope that the us would endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
in 2004 the us scheduled brazil to provide 102 million dollars in drug aid and law enforcement aid.
former air force chief mauro jose miranda gandra, current director of the air institute of the estacio de sa university in rio de janeiro and a general, stated that the government's measure was a courageous step but the impact could be more political than practical because of the restrictions imposed by the brazilian government.
brazilian officials stated that the policy could not be applied against children's aircraft.
viegas stated that there is a need for limits.
gandra stated that the provision undermines the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug smuggling aircraft carrying children, thus introducing the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
viegas stated in an interview in brasilia that the government would use the law more powerfully to dissuade drug traffickers who previously felt they were not threatened by the air force.
the deteriorating public security situation in sao paolo and particularly rio de janeiro, where powerful and increasingly violent drug gangs are active, has prompted the government to act.
in rio de janeiro, drug gangs have more firepower than the police, have successfully attacked police stations and have forced businesses and schools to close.
in an interview with a foreign correspondent in 2003 president luiz inacio lula da silva stated --
policy is about national sovereignty and national security.
some of the pilots of the drug-running aircraft felt so confident of immunity that they made obscene gestures to the brazilian air force pilots in pursuit.
under brazil's prohibition of the death penalty for criminal acts, is the constitution a law?
some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounts to a de facto death sentence for drug traffickers, contrary to the government's claims.
the o estado de sao paolo newspaper in an editorial for the week of july 18-24 stated that the extreme measure raised problems of ethics and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefit.
the person will be extrajudicially penalized on the basis of an administrative decision by the air force commander.
these people gained the power of life and death over the crew members and regular flyers.
brazil inaugurated the sivam radar system in 2002 at a cost of $ 1.4 billion which allows the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive amazon region for the first time.
the system uses united states technology.
illegal flights initially declined by 30 percent due to concerns about improved tracking capabilities of traffickers but subsequently reaccelerated.
brazil recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003.
some of these flights violate the innocent ranchers flying between plantations in the amazon.
viegas stated that deliberate violations of brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who appear to realize the government's inability to retaliate have increased significantly.
in april 2001 fernandinho beira-mar, the most notorious drug boss in rio de janeiro, was captured in colombia in a pipeline of guns for drugs involving left-wing guerrillas.
the northern amazon corridor in brazil has become a busy and increasingly essential route in the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
according to reports the route of the most important supply route for cocaine into europe via drug and gun smuggling runs from colombia to suriname across the northern tier of the amazon.
colombia is currently the only country with a current policy of targeting drug trafficking aircraft.
colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the united states.

international; weapons; leader; military
the venezuelan president's dealings with russia over weapons, curbs on military cooperation with the united states, and plans to train 2 million civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion have worried venezuela and its domestic critics.
chavez's plans to deal with russia over weapons, curb military cooperation and train 2 million civilians to repel a possible imperialist invasion have worried the united states and domestic critics of chavez.
chavez insisted the move was purely defensive and overdue for venezuela to update its obsolete military hardware and protect itself from nations that might want to control venezuela.
venezuela is the country with the most petroleum production in south america.
domestic chavez opponents scoffed at the idea of the us ever invading venezuela and charged that chavez truly intended to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists to protect against any internal rise-up and pose a militarized counterweight to the us' influence in latin america.
castro is a major ally of chavez and the two have grown closer.
detractors of chavez in the us government said the strategy of restructuring venezuelan democracy in the image of the militarized socialism style of cuba could even more troubled venezuelans by purchasing arms and indoctrinating the civilian militias.
us strategists are increasingly concerned about the potential for such a revolution to be fomented by chavez's radical moves, inspired by chavez.
latin american politics has shifted leftward since the late 1990 s.
this leftward shift is largely a reaction to the perceived failure of free market economics.
the left elected to lead brazil, argentina, chile, uruguay, ecuador and venezuela.
chavez's supporters at home countered that the united states has a long history of open and covert armed intervention in the domestic politics of latin america and said that the united states has no right to question venezuela's preparations for defense.
carlos roque espinoza leon said venezuelans never asked what the us marines did.
the venezuelan national assembly, the country's serving government, has espinoza leon as its specialized defense.
espinoza said peru has 500,000 rifles and no one says anything.
espinoza said no one complains about the most militarized country in latin america being colombia.
espinoza said the us history is full of aggression in latin america.
espinoza said venezuelans must do whatever is necessary to protect the country.
chavez said in his fame that the so-called venezuelan bolivarian revolution was a peaceful event but armed.
chavez was first elected in 1998 and according to an independent poll by datanalisis, he has a 71 % popularity rating.
venezuelan military analyst alberto garrido said chavez was looking for allies in russia, china and iran to promote a multi-polar world that would counteract us domination and encourage grass-roots movements in latin america to throw off government influence.
farmer lorenzo campos in the northern venezuelan state of anzoategui and reservists were trained.
campos said venezuelans wanted the world to know they were not preparing an attack on anyone and that the mission was to protect the country.
in may 2005 chavez's government announced details of a deal with a russian firm to purchase 100,000 ak-103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each for 18.6 million dollars and transfer technology to venezuela for manufacture.
the deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle.
the price of these things is considerably less than the $ 825 - $ 850 price of the same weapons ordered through the us postal service.
the venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 russian helicopters, 10 spanish transport planes and 6 naval craft from russia.
venezuelan officials said the government had negotiated with brazil to buy around 24 air and train support planes.
chavez insisted and even the staunchest military critics here agreed that the purchase was essential to update the decades-old belgian military rifles.
retired general fernando ochoa antich said the statement that chavez is engaged in an arms build-up is an exaggeration.
ochoa was defense minister in 1992 when chavez launched a failed coup.
ochoa stated that venezuela has not purchased arms in the past 25 years and that chavez has not bought weapons aggressively or in a threatening manner towards venezuela's neighbors.
ochoa said venezuela never bought arms from russia before and suggested chavez bought the arms to become independent of the us.
ochoa asked why chavez bought the popular caliber rifles and stated that his political support for the radical leftist moves made him a continental menace.
the us pentagon is openly questioning what chavez is doing with the old fal rifles and whether he might be sharing weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in latin america.
the us government has provided no evidence that chavez is arming or funding a leftist insurgency.
military analysts who analyzed the colombian farc guerrillas said the rebels have plenty of money from drug trafficking to buy weapons and are not interested in old rifles from belgium or chavez's assistance.
a 2003 us defense intelligence agency (dia) study reported that more than half of the weapons seized from colombian guerrillas between 1998 and 2001 were of venezuelan origin.
implying that corrupt venezuelan military members or sympathizers could aid the guerrillas.
critics say the chavez-opposing domestic may be more distressed by the chavez-ideology military and civilian reservists that they are mindful of.
so chavez called for the revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist the superpower aggressor earlier in 2005 and said that the resistance would be the first step in training the active duty armed forces backed by volunteers of between 1 million and 2 million in the coming year.
military analysts estimate venezuela's active duty armed forces number at 83000.
the person's defense unit was created in neighborhoods, state companies and the chavez-established free university and reports directly to the president.
the government insists that the reserve supports the armed forces and will not act against the fifth column against chavez's possible coup.
espinoza said that reserves should not be used for troops shocked by any political party and that each person would decide which side to take in a civil war.
the commanders are general julio ramon quintero viloria.
quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians over 20 weekends in the second half of 2005 and that 300,000 more civilians could be trained in 2006.
quintero said venezuelans did not want any empire's colony and were ready for any possibility.
in june 2005 100000 reservists and the venezuelan navy were engaged in a massive war game to repel a stronger invader country.
in june 2005, 40 state oil company employees participated in a similar exercise with 1,200 soldiers.
the chavez-friendly circle here warns of asymmetrical warfare.
asymmetric warfare is a term coined by us strategic military personnel to describe conflicts between unequal combatants in which the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
the us government has given colombia 3.3 billion dollars in military aid over the past five years.
chavez loyalists fear that the us government may instigate a proxy war with venezuela in order to oust chavez and control venezuelan oil.
in interviews, senior us officials dismissed the notion that the us government wants to invade venezuela as utterly complete nonsense.
officials said chavez's side wishes to make a negative relationship because chavez has calculated politically that he can reach power by constantly confronting the us.
another roll-back of chavez's military cooperation and joint exercises troubles the united states.
the us military has had a cooperation office in venezuela for 50 years.
in 2004 chavez shut it down.
5 us military trainers and students participating in the exchange program will leave the country in april 2005.
analysts say chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
analysts say chavez's use of that force to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere is unproven.

the north korean government was able to prepare to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in june 2007 in steps by december 2007.
christopher hill, the assistant secretary of state, stated on june 18, 2007 that the north korean government could be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor by the first step by december 2007.
hill is the head negotiator for the united states in the north korean nuclear weapons program.
hill stated that stalled efforts to dismantle north korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the international atomic energy agency inspectors visit pyongyang on the invitation of pyongyang officials to talk about verification and monitoring of the shutdown.
hill stated following talks with chinese negotiator wu dawei that the shutdown is anticipated to be long.
hill stated that it is possible to shut down in a week or so, but not in a month or so.
the associated press reported that the iaea stated in vienna, austria that the team visited pyongyang in the week of 24 june 2007 to discuss the manner of inspectors' verification of the shutdown and that the team will visit pyongyang again in the week of 18 june 2007.
hill stated that the iaea inspectors held talks with pyongyang officials regarding the reactor seals, including the installation of television monitoring sites.
north korean officials refused to proceed with the agreement to begin decommissioning yongbyon until 25 million dollars in funds held in accounts linked to north korea in macao banks were transferred to north korea.
the money was frozen after united states officials accused banco delta asia of complicity in north korean financial crimes.
the amr graph states that the fund was wired to the new york federal reserve bank on june 14, 2007, after months of disagreement over the method of returning the fund.
the fund is supposed to have been sent to the russian central bank before the transfer of the north korean government's account at a russian commercial bank.
hill stated that talks with russian, south korean and japanese negotiators on disarmament were to take place in the week of june 17, 2007 to recoup time lost in the financial transfer organization.
the timetable for the resumption of six-nation talks on arms control was also discussed.
under the agreement reached in february 2007 north korean officials pledged to shut down yongbyon and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for 50,000 tons of fuel oil shipments.
in return for further 950000 tons of fuel oil north korean officials declared an all-nuclear program and disabled all facilities in the next phase of the agreement.
hill stated that the next phase of the agreement could be concluded by december 2007 technically.

the nuclear suppliers group list shows that iran has denied purchasing nuclear-related materials since 1998 approximately 75 times because of suspicions that the purchases could be used to build a bomb.
the nuclear suppliers group (nsg) is an offshoot of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (npt) and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes does not fall into military use.
the nuclear suppliers group is composed of advanced technology countries.
the nuclear suppliers group's mission statement says that countries will act on an individual basis to block trade that violates export controls devised to maintain international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
the nuclear suppliers group has no enforcement powers beyond notifying companies of violations of its guidelines.
the nuclear suppliers group keeps data private and meets in large secrecy.
most of the denials have occurred since 2002 and have resulted in intervention by the member countries of the nuclear suppliers group.
diplomats from countries with an interest in exposing the extent of iran's efforts to acquire so-called dual-use items that could be converted into weapons were made available a list of trade denials.
the list is available, provided that the diplomats and their countries are not identified.
the list includes australian, finnish, swedish and united arab emirates companies prevented from carrying out deals because they were suspected of selling items with military use.
the items listed for sale as part of a block deal offer include nickel powder, petrochemical plant components, compressors, furnaces, steel flanges and fittings, electron microscopes, ore-sorting radiometric machines, valves and tubing, lasers, rotary drilling rigs, mass spectrometers, nitrogen production plants.
the government of iran, the country's atomic energy organization, power companies, engineering companies, petrochemical companies refining oil, gas companies, the aircraft industry, schools and universities, engine manufacturers, mineral research centers, helicopter support companies, plasma physics centers are among iran's end-use organizations.
diplomats stated that the denials represented only the actions of 7 of the 45 member states.
diplomats stated that the actual number of denials of the sale of dual-use products to iran is much higher than 75.
western diplomats stated that the iranian government was using front companies undetectably to receive technology and convert it into weapons production, causing the standoff over iran's nuclear program to continue.
iran has signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty but is not a member of the nuclear suppliers group.

iran's fars news agency stated that the hacker group known as xp has defaced or blocked hundreds of websites related to shiites.
the official website of iraq's leading shiite cleric, grand ayatollah ali al-sistani, was included in a list of websites that have been defaced or blocked.
xp stated on the defaced website that any website containing material contrary to sunni teachings would be hacked.
the website of iraq's top shiite religious leader grand ayatollah ali al-sistani was defaced and blocked in a cyber attack motivated by sectarianism.
the attack did not begin on 080918 or 080919 morning.
al-sistani's website was offline on 19 september 2008 evening.
the website www.al-shia.com, which is related to one of al-sistani's religious organizations, was also affected.
the alternative address www.sistani.com is still operational.
iran's fars news agency stated that xp has blocked access to approximately 300 shiite-related sites from 080918 to 080919.
the claims of the hack and iran's assertions that the xp group is based in the united arab emirates cannot be verified independently.
several iranian news sites stated on september 19, 2008 that many of the websites related to shiite muslims and iran that were attacked had again run normally.
a statement signed by the xp group was posted on al-sistani's home page on the xp site and stated that the attack was on behalf of the sunni muslims.
the statement said --
xp groups carried out attacks on other shiite sites in the persian gulf and iraq in a similar manner.
xp groups erased the site by doing other rafidha sites.
rafidha means rejectionist and the insult used by sunni extremists to describe shiites.
al-sistani has promoted sex deviancy and the iranian agenda in iraq as he bears in iraq.
any website with material contrary to sunni teachings will be punished.
the statement also consisted of a youtube video clip of united states comedian bill maher ridiculing a fatwa from al-sistani on whether certain sexual positions are permissible for married couples.
the office of the ayatollah in the city of najaf declined to comment on the cyber attack.
fars reported that counterattacks were carried out against two major wahhabi websites belonging to the puritanical strain of sunni islam which dominates saudi arabia.

the somali pirates who hijacked the ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms approached the pirates with a deal to release the ship.
questions emerge regarding the arms shipments to kenya and possible clandestine arms deals with south sudan.
20081008 maritime officials and associates of the somali pirates who hijacked the ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms on 080925 stated that the pirates could collect their ransom soon.
after difficult negotiations involving several people involved in haggling in the bazaar style, the party came close to reaching a deal that would pay pirates millions of dollars and free the ship.
ahmed omar ahmed of xarardheere in somalia stated that pirates had agreed to a ransom of approximately 8 million u.s. dollars from the ship owners and that the ship could be freed on 081008 or 081009.
xarardheere is a pirate base on the coast of somalia.
a kenyan maritime official stated that there is yet to be an agreement on critical details.
such details involve pirates' request for a guarantee that they will not be arrested or attacked by the united states' warships currently encircling them.
a kenyan maritime official was quoted as saying such negotiations are complex and involve more than financial aspects.
officials stated on october 8, 2008 that progress was made and the parties approached an agreement.
pirates initially requested $ 35 million in u.s. dollars and then reduced it to $ 20 million.
the pirates have consistently expressed a willingness to negotiate over financial figures.
more than 25 ships were hijacked off the somali coast in 2008, typically ransomed for between $ 1 and $ 200,000 u.s.
ukrainian ship and its cargo and crew of 20 were released when the pirates received payment of $ 1 million in united states dollars and their preferred 100 dollar bills.
the original destination countries of the arms shipments that boarded ukrainian ships were -
the kenyan government claimed that the weapons were being shipped to the kenyan military shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 september 2008.
ships via mombasa, kenya's main port.
the weapons on board include 33 t-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
subsequently, evidence emerged of the kenyan government's clandestine arms deal with the southern sudanese separatists.
if the pirates had not hijacked the ship and had not begun speaking to the media by satellite phone, the deal was most likely to remain secret.
ukrainian officials are adamant in denying any wrongdoing.

ukraine has not supplied any arms to the government of south sudan and has no plans to do so.
all appropriate paperwork has been validated.
ukraine will abide by all un rules and arms control agreements.
ukraine inherited an enormous stockpile of weaponry after the collapse of the soviet union and is now a major arms dealer.
the deal with ukraine is suspicious because kenya relies most on the united kingdom and other western countries for heavy weapons supplies.
kenyan politicians have demanded answers and called for several commissions to examine the situation.
southern sudan, which has increased its military capabilities in recent years and uses soviet-designed tanks, is a region of autonomy.
the united states military stated that it would prioritize ensuring that the shipment of weapons did not unload and that the weapons were not sold to somali islamists.
pirates denied having any interest in the weapons and claimed they were unaware that tanks were included in the cargo when they hijacked the ship.
pirate spokesman sugule ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates' sole interest in the deal was money.

u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said that afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban have cut back cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in order to support the price and preserve the major source of insurgency financing.
u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said that afghanistan produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban cut back cultivation of poppy and stockpiled raw opium in order to support the price and preserve the major source of insurgency financing.
last week, as the u.n. drug office prepared to release its latest survey of afghanistan's opium crops, costa said this to reporters:
the survey showed that poppy cultivation has retreated much in afghanistan and is overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of the 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, mostly in the southern provinces.
the survey was issued on november 27, 2008.
the united nations found that the amount of land devoted to opium production in afghanistan was reduced by 19 percent, although total production of opium dropped just 6 percent.
the study attributes high output to a good growing season in the southern states.
the heavy irrigation of the south, where the taliban maintains a strong presence in five provinces and has systematically encouraged opium cultivation for several years to finance its insurgency.
the u.n. estimates that insurgents made much more than $ 300 million from opium trading last year.
costa said the war effort could be funded by between 200 million and 3 billion dollars.
the taliban produced an amount of opium far in excess of world demand, for three successive bumper crop years.
costa said the result would be a glut with prices depressed by approximately 20 percent.
costa said the absence of a price collapse already indicated that taliban, drug lords and even some farmers were stockpiling opium.
the amount of increased also took place in afghanistan.
costa added that the insurgents were holding a significant amount of opium.
costa said the surplus was as much as 11000 tons (11000 metric tons) or more than twice the world's demand three years ago and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
the united nations found that afghanistan produced 8,500 tons of opium in 2008.
world demand is estimated at about 4400 tons per year.
this year the taliban stood passively by as the cultivation took place and put less pressure on afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
then this supports the current price.
costa is a 6-year diplomat with the u.n. office on drugs and crime (undoc) from italy.

hong kong police are trying to prevent triad or transnational criminal syndicates from engaging in criminal activity.
hong kong police recently smashed a transnational theft syndicate specializing in exploiting youngsters to commit various crimes, a criminal syndicate specializing in crossing the boundary and exploiting youngsters, and a local triad gang specializing in exploiting youngsters.
the hong kong oriental daily news opined that the recent police effort to cut down five people including so-called " leaders " of triad branches and " leaders " of district teams after three weeks of short period of time would determine the police's eradication of criminal activities.
hong kong police recently worked closely with the public security bureau in guangdong province to exchange intelligence and carried out a series of raids and operations.
hong kong police cracked down on triad activities including drug trafficking, illegal possession of arms, theft, burglary, robbery, the sale of pirated and obscene records, and the sale of duty-free cigarettes from 070000 july 18 to 070000 july 24.
a police report stated that over 100 staff were dispatched on july 24, 2002 to storm a propitiatory dance and wine party organized to settle some disputes between two triad groups that had taken place at a disco nightclub in kowloon's mongkok district.
police eventually arrested 3 branch leaders and 14 core triad members.
a police source confirmed to xinhua news agency on july 25 that all 17 arrested persons are still in questioning.
a hong kong police source said the operation had netted all 17 people and was the result of police efforts to infiltrate relevant gangs here.
the police source also intimated that the hong kong police's crackdown on other triad gangs would also follow.
hong kong police's anti-criminal-organization efforts involve police cooperation in mainland china and other regions, which is part of police activities.
the first conference called targeting the far east, the international drug enforcement conference, held in hong kong earlier in july 2002.
hong kong was chosen to host the event following a decision made at the idec meeting held in bolivia in february 2002.
42 senior narcotics officers from mainland china, hong kong, australia, indonesia, japan, south korea, myanmar, the philippines, singapore, thailand and the united states met.
a recent internal news letter of the hong kong police reported that the aim of the conference is to provide a flexible and forward-thinking environment for information sharing and positive action against transnational drug trafficking criminals.
the hong kong police-intelligence exchange with police on the mainland of china is particularly intense.
a delegation of 11 members from china's mainland national narcotics control commission recently visited hong kong to study how hong kong police enforce their anti-narcotics laws.
the team of 11 people was chaired by deputy director of the bureau of narcotics control of the chinese ministry of public security, chen cunyi, and briefed by hong kong police on enforcement actions carried out in hong kong, and ip lau chuen, head of the hong kong narcotics bureau, led the team.
the hong kong police also exchanged mutual concerns with the chinese national narcotics control commission and discussed a number of issues, including investigations into drug trafficking and money laundering activities.
the mainland parties closed their visit after meeting hong kong deputy assistant commissioner of criminal affairs yam tat wing and discussed further proposals for cooperation in combating cross-boundary drug trafficking activities.

french foreign minister dominique de villepin said on 03 june 2003 that the french government considers the crackdown on the iranian armed opposition group the people's mujahedeen as part of the anti-terrorism operation.
french prime minister de villepin said on france info radio that the people's mujahedeen claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in iran and that the dimensions of this terrorism cannot be hidden.
de villepin said the justice would decide the arrest and there was no diplomatic factor in this affair.
de villepin said the french action was based on strict justice and determined to fight terrorism all.
french police raided the headquarters of the people's mujahedeen organization in the northwest of paris on 22 june 2003.
the people's mujahedeen accused the french authorities of having a part in the deal with the iranian government and carrying out the operation.
the iranian government has denied these claims.
the judiciary is now investigating 17 members of the mujahedeen organization for alleged links to terrorist organizations and for funding terrorist activities.
initially some 160 people were detained in the crackdown on over 10 people's mujahedeen locations in france.
during the police raid paris maps with out marked streets relating to the american embassy, bullet proof jackets, transmitting equipment, more than 200 computers and about 9 million dollars in cash were seized.
the united states, the european union and iran classified the people's mujahedeen as a terrorist organization.
the people's mujahedeen was formed in the 1960 s by young iranians with college educations and is described as a leftist islamist organization.
the people's mujahedeen staged terrorist attacks inside iran in the 1970 s and killed several us military personnel and civilians working on defense projects in teheran.
the people's mujahedeen is part of a broad coalition that initially supported the iranian revolution and participated in the takeover of the us embassy in teheran in 1979.
the people's mujahedeen and the government have suffered fall-out and since the 1980 s have built military bases in iraq and political bases in europe.
the people's mujahedeen claimed responsibility for the assassination of several iranian regime members in recent years.
this assassination is as much as the assassination of assodalah ladjevardi, the former director of teheran's evin prison in 1998 and the assassination of ali sayad chirazi, a former iranian army chief commander and general in 1999.

i'm 24 and my mother is 2.5.
i've been broken up with my son's father since august.
i want to start dating other people and my father's ex-wife said that she has nothing to do with me.
he is very possessive and controlling, but he doesn't have a right to be because we are together.
right now his life is going on too much and he thinks we can work but i told him several times i don't love him and he doesn't love me.
i want him to be there with his son, he doesn't need me too.
but he has no one, his family don't get along with him and they have issues.
i don't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he's around the more miserable i am.
i don't want him to be there because he's a good father or at least trying to be one.
i believe every child needs both parents, whether together or not.
but he thinks that if he cann't have me, no one can.
what am i to do? my life is on the move.
it's very bad that your ex-significant other is threatening you using your son.
you cann't give in to that or it just escalates.
you have the right to live your life and be happy, so you're not going to cave in to his threats.
he would see his son regardless, but this is just the typical method of control used by people like him.
other people said it was like i was killing myself if you left me. does it get through to you?
when is your date?
meet all kinds of people.
do what you want.
if he had to walk out of your lives voluntarily at his own price, you'd probably be better off without him.
i agree, the other thing is that he is not in business whether you are dating or not.
i didn't tell him.
he didn't threaten you, he didn't care about your personal life.
can you document his threats?
you really need this.
quit taking his calls and make him leave voice mail.
make him email or text you.
keep that record.
get a lawyer and divorce.
if you cann't afford one, try for legal aid.
tell your ex-significant other that all communications need to go through a lawyer.
the bus driver, the people till, the people delivering your food want the exact change.
do they realize that you don't get a pile of change from the bank?
someone has to take notes somewhere?
people get lazy.
i'd like to be as near as possible, because i don't like counting copper all day.
if you take a twenty pound note on the bus, they will just tell you to get on the bus because they are hell lazy.
it is not illegal to pay a certain amount in coins for example you can only pay 30 pence in pennies.
hello, i started uni in september but obviously i didn't gel with it immediately like most people do.
but i know that my adjustment will take some time because i'm very introverted, shy, especially anxious and all the rest.
on my first night here, i went out with all my housemates and it was the most hardest thing i've ever had to do.
i went to a bar by myself when i was sober.
here's the point though:
i didn't enjoy university after being here for about 5 months, my course disillusioned me, i didn't enjoy the set project and i didn't like the course delivery much.
the university is making out much better than it seems.
i started off badly, finances for students are delayed and added to my stress levels, so worried i couldn't progress with my work, so all in conclusion piled up.
i was assigned a counselor at the university, saw him in a block session for about 5-6 weeks, and in my honest opinion it didn't really work out because i never opened up to him.
only half hearted
i'm loaded with work to my neck, i have to hit major deadlines, i'm depressed and anxiety results in feeling miserable all the time.
i no longer have a counselor because you can only have a person at a time and i doubt it would help me much if it didn't already.
i lacked motivation, i didn't feel comfortable with my lecturer, and i felt like i wanted to give in but i couldn't because i ended up with a dead end job and i aspire to be someone.
i'd rather die than be uneducated and not live the life i want to live, and the matter is getting worse by dropping out of university.
i'm 21, turning 22 this year, i don't have much time to fail and i have to do something.
i failed college once and did another course so i could get into university.
could someone please advise me as to what is possible?
and you can go and see your doctor and see if there is any way you can extend your deadline to try and ease the pressure a bit.
snt1 send an email like this to your tutor, they will consider mitigating circumstances, don't worry, they have seen all before. i know, i used to work in the university administration department.
break your work into manageable chunks.
concentrate on one bit of work at a time, the most urgent assignment obviously.
don't shut off your housemate and do well because you are trying something new from the very beginning. keep it now.
i would recommend that you go see your doctor too.
you might benefit from speaking to someone if you are always anxious, it's really normal for my friend to get therapy from the nhs because of anxiety.
try to get an extension, if you're honest i'm sure your uni will allow it.
it's hard to keep strong and keep on living.
my mum divorced, she had horrible times with my stepfather and she was sent round the bend by the new freedom she found.
she has epilepsy and is manically depressed with huge anger problems.
she is constantly horrible to me.
i cann't cope with her outbursts and hateful nasty remarks when i'm at home.
at the point of my break i was 18 years old and had a 95 % bursary studying full time at a private school with high pressure in the 6 th form.
i cann't work from home because she shouts at me.
then i got angry at my teachers for that.
she was lovely in one minute, like i had my mummy back, then she turned into the most spiteful living human next minute.
i didn't pass my a2 exams and i've already accepted that i'm going to be defeated and that this year of my life is going to make me fail.
i don't know if i can come back to this, but the university has offered me the most amazing offer, but i cann't even accept it. i've never made a grade in my life.
i wish i could wipe her out from my life, things would be so much better without her.
but then i thought, " i'm just selfish ".
but surely this is not what i'm meant to be living like, is it?
it's so much better.
but i feel like i'm powerless to control this downhill spiral.
and i don't know what to do.
thank you for reading.
nice vent.
you cann't get her section for that.
even does she have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis?
you sure don't know you won't get a good grade, so you accept a place if possible.
life throws things at you all the time.
if you are not in your family, then you are an outsider.
i've dealt with verbal abuse from my dad for 8 years and honestly i'm only here because it's the only way out for me.
if you really want out, work hard.
really, if she cann't give you consistent support, you need to get it from somewhere else.
can you call childline or something like it?
you can go to the library on saturday and study for 8 good hours.
would you go to your friend's house to form a study group?
so, she's got a bit of arse pain and you blame her for all your problems, do you want to section her?
i know how you feel.
my mum spits from hell too.
i would highly recommend taking up smoking.
oh tsr grew up and stopped nagging, it's a joke.
i think i became much weaker person in the last 2 years and way down my personality to try to befriend some people at university.
but people who are nicer than that lead people to believe that they can say whatever they want to hell and do whatever they want to me.
they show absolutely no respect.
for example, i say hello to someone from the university, and they ignore me, but later on in the 30 minutes they decide they want my help with some work, and i give it.
it caused a lot of anger and distress in my life and it really started to affect my concentration at university.
anyone get any experience handling things like this or how to go about getting some respect back again?
just say no.
if it doesn't particularly comfortable you, do it gradually.
you could start with " sorry i'm not busy "
of course you wouldn't go over the top with it, you wouldn't go in completely the opposite direction.
if you think no, but you mind no, then you will say no.
when they start to realize that you are not going to bend backwards over for them, they start to respect you more.
this is really such a bad attitude, well of course you can be respected, if you are not nice, but just let them do anything to you, then that is not nice, that is foolish.
i don't know if anyone is reading this but i just feel despair and i need to tell someone.
i left home in september and started university, i am incredibly anxious about doing this but i am delaying thinking about it until i get here, i am here now and will be here in two weeks, i feel overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and awkward socially.
i have been emotionally struggling since i moved to secondary school, i lost my dad around the age of 9 and always blamed it on how i felt, i have had 2 periods of counselling in my life, the first was in 2009 december and the second was this year around march.
i feel like i'm having a moment where i feel like my problems in life are overwhelming and i'm making myself doubt my self esteem which is always low. i cann't concentrate on work, i often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions and i doubt myself about anything and everything.
my two counsellors did not diagnose me with depression and suggested i was not suffering from depression but i was huge worried about depression as it was the cause of my dad's death and his suicide.
i tried to solve my problems before, found particular usefulness in exercises and meditation, also tried things like self-help books and tapes. but generally speaking, i feel this is my life, this is what i am. i am wasting one chance to exist, one chance to be a young man.
i simply don't know what to do, i never follow through on what i think i should do, my friends often say i'm lazy, and i cann't disagree a lot of the time, i feel like people are trying to do everything they can to help, but i fail again and again.
sorry to anyone who has read this jumbled mess and contrarily i feel a bit like a self-seeking moaner but i am truly desperate.
as people are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into new roles (e.g. university student), their existing feelings for people become more intense.
i'm not a health professional, and i can only speak from my own personal experience, so i strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional for your depression feelings and worries.
snt1 feel like most people feel awkward and unintelligent when they first get to university, so you're definitely not alone there. snt2 i really recommend you get some counselling at your university, i mean really. snt3 it doesn't really matter what anyone tells you, you're depressed or not. snt4 you have some obvious problems, and you can have some support. snt5 labels aren't as important as the experiences you have, and snt6 meditation and exercise are really helpful, so try and do them. snt7 but you have to engage with help and general life to get somewhere, but don't beat yourself up because you don't feel motivated to do anything at the minute. snt8 a lot of people feel like this, and hopefully it will pass when you start to feel better. snt9 you're not kind to yourself, that's only going to make you feel worse. snt10 kind to yourself and get some help.
good luck
i think a lot of people would feel the same way as you, but they would probably be medicated using their friends, but that is not necessarily the solution, being around your friends when you are depressed is definitely better than being alone and depressed, either way if you fancy a chat, you can message me privately.
if you are me, i focus on the idol. you aspire to someone who comes from a bad background and ends up succeeding, happy, having a family, marrying etc. but not you. someone you admire and respect.
you focus on what you have achieved in life, you don't state what you have studied or indeed why you have studied it, because you want the experience, because your mum wants you to go, because you need a degree for the career you want,
so either way, you sum up why you're there and work your butt off to get the best grade you can, because when you get your degree you have something to say like " hey, i didn't fail, i worked hard and passed "
x
i hope this helps.
i'm not pretty much autistic (i think the doctor misdiagnosed me, but i'm not) but i walk on my toes nearly all the time.
it's more comfortable for me.
so why did they make the decision that walking on toes is a sign of autism? because it seems so random and it's not always an indicator.
well, i can have things that are signs of something on the autism spectrum, but how many?
you guys know what i mean.
walking on toes could be a symptom of autism.
headaches can be a symptom of brain tumors.
feeling tired a lot could be a symptom of leukaemia.
the symptoms are not always applicable, but if they occur in a lot of cases, as is clearly the case in this instance, then it is worth noting, and if not noted, then there will never be a diagnosis.
i'm walking on my toes but it's because i'm bearing with strange under-curled toes that had to be surgically straightened two years ago.
my brother is autistic, but i didn't notice either, so the spectrum is so broad, and i probably have a mild form of asperger's, which is why i have problems with communication and don't pick up on social/body language.
then i don't have the proper diagnosis and you might even have some symptoms but that doesn't mean you have a certain condition.
i don't walk on my toes much because i was told not to for years and years.
i have dyspraxia.
so you could be dyspraxic or have short tendons.
i've drill it to the dancers/gymnasts/ballet people etc and now i find it more comfortable.
i read too much about random symptoms that resemble that.
hello, i'm 12 years old (2 days from now i'll be 13) and i'm addicted to self harm.
i started slitting my fingers with scissors when i was 7 and never stopped from that day on.
it's gotten worse because i have a scar on my leg from when i slit it open stapling to the name of my ex boyfriend because i didn't stop the cut when i was bleeding.
i have several slits in my arm.
they healed and i then cut myself with a staple and razor blade that i had robbed from school.
i took around 5 paracetamols and other drugs with lager and vodka when we couldn't find the cutting tools.
i'm really tempted to cut off my arms or burn myself to death while writing this.
i'm an addict, i'll cut again when one heals.
i think about it every day.
i'm 12 years old and my life is already sick.
this is from a graphic i made of my dad leaving me at 7 years old and not wanting to know me anymore.
he just cares about his little new girlfriend and his wife and his new life that i don't want.
my best mate died when i was 10 years old.
i'm in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and i'm forbidden to speak to him because of the age difference and the events that have happened.
my mum also suffers from bipolar and i have depression.
i don't want to stop.
i don't care what i do, i want to do it over and over again to torture myself, i hate myself.
but i love my best mate to bits, he means the world to me and if he did anything i would do anything.
i wouldn't tell him, but he'll find out.
i don't want to hurt him, he doesn't want to hurt himself.
what do you mean?
thank you for reading.
are you on any drugs or do drugs get any therapy?
talk to your school nurse or gp and tell them what's going on.
your trusted person who you can tell might be a school teacher.
if you tell them, they might be able to help you.
if you keep it bottled up inside, it's only going to get worse.
i trust you. it's better to get this thing as early as possible instead of letting it even worsen.
don't do this.
i'm 17 and i started self harming (mainly cutting my arms) last year but i stopped a few months ago.
it's hard but you can do it.
i feel so much happier but when i see the scar it reminds me of how i felt at that time and how strong those feelings were that i wanted to do such things to myself.
it's also strong, you can do it. i found salvation through writing poetry and keeping a journal.
self harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
remember, self harm is not a defining characteristic of who you are.
you can overcome it.
so i think i got ocd form because i found that i always have to check my belongings to make sure i don't lose or leave anything behind whenever i go out especially to university, which i did last year.
i have to check every 2 go's often and after 30 seconds i cann't resist checking again for some reason.
what caused this?
i'm crazy or something?
it is often the case that it carries many things, but rarely carries any, and even checks many times a day, is this any extent of ocd?
what can i do about this?
i get very anxious if i don't check, often it's the anxiety that causes me not to be able to wait that long.
i feel doomed if i lose my wallet or phone.
i just wish i could go out without worrying about leaving something or losing something every two minutes.
i really don't know what to do and i'm afraid to go to a general practitioner.
they probably never heard of some compulsion like this and i just don't know what to do.
do any of you have a similar ritual?
people think i'm crazy but it's very strange how you get yourself out of this.
what advice can you give me?
i used to do this on my way to college, and had a list of items i knew i had, and used to compulsively check on the bus.
i know it's easier to say than do, but now i have more severe anxiety and i think this is a warning sign, so you just try to wean yourself off the habit when it's relatively fresh, and definitely visit your doctor, but also tell them not to keep checking this thing.
don't worry about that, the doctor saw a much worse case.
i did ocd in psych class today, lol.
you can just avoid compulsive acts, then you won't have to check to see if you lost something and just leave it.
your ocd levels will gradually decrease over time (hopefully disappearing over time) but your anxiety levels will increase over time.
that just sounds like you're anxious instead of having a really bad ocd.
i get up every 20 minutes at night to check that all the locks in my house are particularly locked.
sometimes i am convinced they are not locked, even though i know they are.
when the obsessive interruptions really start to really interrupt your daily routine, i think it becomes a real problem.
you definitely aren't crazy so don't worry, and i'm sure your gp will understand the issue.
i also went for therapy for other reasons and they encouraged me to pick a number less than 20 for my checks and stick to it and cut down.
i think my idea is good and i'm still ok if i check 5 times or 20 times.
i'm a lot better so far and i definitely think anyone who wants improvement will improve.
i'm usually pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and i'm not too worried about it.
but i found myself becoming really anxious about the thing before now in the last 1-2 months and i'm not talking about mere nervousness from the blue.
i began to feel panicky in an irrational way about a variety of things that i hadn't worried about too much before, even crossing my mind as something that caused alarm bells to ring in my head.
i'm not sure whether this is because of this lifestyle change (going from a free care student to an unemployed graduate) or whether this is a sign of other issues, but this is beginning to bug me because it's affecting my confidence and happiness.
i spoke to a few people including my parents, but all think i should go into random phase and hold off on acting until the serious problems are cleared up.
so what's the best thing to do?
you speak to the doctor and see if there is a possibility of the anxiety counter pills taking the edge off from the thing?
do i see myself speaking to a counselor?
or should i take the advice of the people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem?
well, i wouldn't start trying to eye your anxiety, it'll make me tense and more likely to panic you more. there's a circle of death there.
i would recommend that you try to focus on something that will guarantee you a smile or make you feel happier when you start to feel a bit panicky.
or if you cann't do that, you get your friends to make you laugh when you start feeling panicky, it works for me and i suffer random panic attacks and i'll loudly laugh about it.
so yeah, it just started to really worry me, but not as much as you, because it doesn't sound as severe as you.
i find just talking to someone else about the things that make you anxious helps.
i find it a bit of a moot point, i mentioned my worries to my mum and she reacted to the situation in a calm way as i had recommended, which made me feel better about the situation, so i knew it was a big deal but i didn't need to be anxious about it.
but if it worsens, go to the doctor.
i have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that prevents him from leaving the house and doing things, because he is so worried that something might go wrong.
the doctor gave her medication and it made her much better.

it's not going to take long.
route 288, a circumferential highway that runs around the southwest quadrant of the richmond-new-urban-region, opened in late 2004.
it has already changed the developmental pattern because of worsening and caused the localized traffic congestion around its exits.
the richmond times dispatch tells the tale of the impact of the huguenot trail in powhatan county today.
will jones reported that traffic on one section of huguenot trail has more than doubled since the opening of 288.
speed and accident deaths have also surged.
so far this year, 17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of winterfield road and up to 12 accidents have occurred all year.
dale totten of the virginia department of transportation, which is the resident engineer, said that if they had more money, they would have four lanes of road, which would cost about $ 13 million.
of course vdot doesn't have the money to construct roads in the richmond region.
because vdot spent all their frigging money on 288 because of local politicians and boosters.
where is homer simpson when you need him?
this is a major doh moment.
we predict that route 288 will generate residential development in the scarce populated area around all of the exit roads, overtaxing the local country roads.
other people choose where they work and where they live, but limited access highways can relieve traffic for people who drive back and forth between chesterfield and goochland counties.
and they create traffic congestion in new places.
only this rapidity surprises me.
even i think it could be 3 or 4 years.
think about it, route 288 has already created this road at a cost of $ 13 million just at this one exit.
another predictable thing.
the need for new road improvements soared after a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of a megacommerce project at the intersection of 288 and a major road.
well, we may see by the end of the decade that liability for the unfunded highway has zoomed well past the $ 400 million that the original highway build took.
the idea is that such a great idea is being thought of by a brainiac named route 288.
thank you for nothing.
i think we could spend 4 billion elsewhere better.
i think you shouldn't blame 288 for creating those people.
what if there are alternatives, but not enough to create new congestion in new places?
will traffic be congested in the old place as well?
now you understand what tmt in fairfax feels.
i usually take the road position.
288 is definitely excessive with glaring needs in other parts of the state.
richmond has virtually no traffic.
the rush hour lasted 30 minutes.
and you give them the beltway through a large rural area.
road to nowhere.
just think, this money could be spent on another potomac river crossing or desperately needed road improvements in nova.
the insult to virginia centrists is that the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in last year's budget deal and that added insult to injury, wiping out the debt.
very nice of you all to oblige us.
but there's not much sense in that.
the same problem has been around for ages.
if you get ahead of the need, you're the cause of sprawl.
if you build in places where there is already an acute need, you cann't pave your way out of congestion.
anonymous person
that's a fair point.
5:26 made a good point.
but this situation hammers home the validity of the auditor's report which found that the ctb and vdot had funded transport projects on the basis of the best lobbying, instead of on the basis of a comprehensive state transportation plan.
i have submitted this situation as unacceptable and a disgrace.
and senator chichester and his toadies have poured more money into this flawed institution, making it worse.
what is the purpose of the transportation expenditures?
in virginia, it is for the benefit of private business plans, not for public interest.
you're dead wrong.
walter stoch stated that the money for economic development was not intended to pay for 288.
come on folk.
tmt, i don't understand your point.
how long have you been stuck in traffic last time you weren't destined for or from some sort of business?
as a whole, it seems to me that the roads are there to facilitate the public's interest in getting into and from private business.
business support is overwhelming, but it's sunday, grandmother's location is being tripped and of course there's a soccer game.
we wouldn't be suffering from congestion problems if our road expenditures didn't not match the increase in business or domestic or state products.
if we recognize that the primary benefit of roads is to business, then we should do two things.
business will pay more for what they pass us of course, and we will incentivize them to locate where they will at least stress the system the least, even if it means more overall travel.
why is it so hard to understand?
to solve the functional pattern of human settlement and the balance between the transport system's capacity and travel demand generated by land use.
all else is spin.
emr
tmt said it was for the benefit of private business plans and not for the public interest in virginia.
i don't see the point of this statement because it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else.
i think they are intertwined and tightly so because they are virtually the same.
the problem is local because this cookie dough is lumpy.
but eventually, if we demonize business long enough, we will find ourselves all working for the devil.
i don't see why the claim that it is a solution to the balance of a dynamic natural system that is ever changing is being made.
even you will see the positive of the rail to dulles because it is a job center and will promote the bidirectional demand.
i agree.
in fact, that reason alone is in fact sufficient, all by itself.
i would say that the same logic should be applied to roads.
they should have a destination at the end of both so we can use our investments to the maximum.
we need more places to get closer to the balance that you say we need.
reality check here.
i drive past watkins landing every morning and evening.
i commute back and forth from my work location on huguenot trail.
i never saw anything remotely like a traffic flood.
it's 55 mph in a zone where cars are going 75-100 mph in the morning.
the huguenot trail road has already been widened because of heavy development demands from the chesterfield side, a new school, and a whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned years ago and have been funneled through robious road.
288 is wonderful for those of us who actually use it instead of the bottleneck that lack of 288 is for powhatan and west chesterfield county.
we can develop commercially and work more closely with our neighbours.
you might think that's irrational use of land, but...
i don't desire to live in any city.
i refuse to work in the downtown area.
i refuse to use mass transit that is unsafe for female commuters who work long hours outside of regular work hours.
and i would like to see a lot of development happen.
i don't understand exactly how i'm keeping horses on a quarter acre lot, supposedly.
a gallon of gas could go for $ 10.
and i still pay my taxes in the country.
many people legitimately prefer horses, hunting, gardening, and certain small businesses over living in the core of the urban areas.
this infatuation with city living truly baffles me.
anonymous 6:37 am, if a person wishes to live in a country, they have every right to do so.
but you're not right in that the rest of the state should underwrite the construction of a 4 billion dollar highway so it's easier to shop and get to work.
the 400 million dollar road, 288, was consistently overlooked in the debate.
if money is applied to other pressing road projects or even to projects that god forbid are not roads, much of the traffic congestion can be alleviated.
ray hyde, my comments are directed at investors who lobby for roads to be placed near their own property and incompetent systems that fund these requests regardless of whether they are linked to the master transportation plan or not.
