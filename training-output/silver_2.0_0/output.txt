support the starter resolutely, i am replying to compose a poem.
pledge to fight to the death to defend the diaoyu islands and related islands.
the fishing boat fleet was bumped; the little evil ghost of japan stirred up trouble and unrest; they showed their wolfish appearance again with a stolen heart and an arrogant form.
never go back to that time when we appeared in a humiliating way when signing the treaty, china is strong, the sword is sharp, the knife is shining, let's bury the approaching enemy.
2010-09-11
i agree with the starter's analysis, if war really comes, i will be hua mulan to protect our home, defend our homeland, spread the prestige of our china, and pledge to fight to the death to defend our national dignity.
i wish i could have been born in that passionate and upsurge long march of mao zedong, so that i could lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all the enemies of china, and spread our dragon prestige.
how long will we tolerate japan?
i say fellow citizens.
hello everyone, we all know about the september 18th incident, but now japan is again planning premeditatedly for another incident at sea, like the lugou bridge incident.
japan surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world and openly invaded our sacred territory (diaoyu islands).
diaoyu islands have always belonged to china, we all know that, because of historical reasons, what we originally belonged to has become controversial.
i say to my fellow citizens, what is ours is ours, why the need for negotiation? because japan went even further, they want to create a fact of occupation. can we allow this? absolutely not.
i say to my fellow citizens of japan, your militarism is bringing grave disasters to asia.
china especially suffered from japan's ravages for several long decades.
the japanese unit 731 conducted cruel and cruel human body experiments on chinese, korean and other people in the northeast region with extreme brutal methods, adding a layer of blood that will never fade away in the ancient capital city of nanjing with the nanjing massacre. over a thousand kilometers away from hengyang and changsha, the bloody big battle barely left the bones of the dead and killed off everything.
i say there are too many instances of heinous crimes committed by japan in china that are difficult to record without all the bamboo strips being exhausted, my fellow citizens.
just like those deceased millions who lost their lives, they wander over the pacific ocean and find it difficult to rest in peace.
still, all those who experienced that era would remember it vividly, and even our younger generation would also cry tears streaming down our cheeks, and our blood would boil with indignation when we turn to and read this page of history.
actually, japan now actually wants to reverse the verdict on its aggressive history, so it has woken up fellow chinese and citizens of asia.
we must go forward, despite the pain of looking back at these 100 years of shame, but we must create history and choose history, and not have history resolve the issue.
we have no fear because we are responsible. the territory is small but it is related to matters of dignity. the honor of the country and the national unity is guaranteed regardless of how the wind and clouds change. we cannot let our native land be separated even if it is scarred with wounds.
i say to my fellow citizens, the 21 st century advent of the chinese nation means that we are in a time when difficulties beset us from within, but pressures come from outside. we face many challenges.
how should we go about the taiwan issue, tibet issue, south china sea issue, surrounding environment, aggressive foreign forces towards china?
fellow citizens, what do you say? look at the world map and you will see that the crescent-shaped encirclement is suppressing our breath, strangling our development, coveting our national territory.
we never fear people, but we don't want to make our enemies. we don't fear war, but we don't want war.
we must urgently arrange arms and strengthen all military forces on land, at sea and in the air.
chinese nations have flourished for several thousand years, but never had the ambition to expand its territory outward.
we follow a strategic foreign security philosophy that applies benevolence and virtue.
like the tolerance and liberalness of the country is like the tolerance and liberalness of the individual, we must insist that we will not be hurt, but we must avoid hurting other people.
tolerance is not a certain fear, sincerity is not cowardice.
china's exemption of japan from war reparations for world war ii serves the cause of peace and benevolence.
i say to my fellow citizens, the people's heroes monument is a condensed history of the chinese nation that has strived for and continues to strive for improvement.
the solemn and magnificent posture represents the sacred expectation of peace.
the many stirring scenes of shining spears and armored horses that spring up in my mind occasionally agitate my memory strings to think.
my thoughts went through those yellow pages of history like seeing the kangxi emperor, who alone in his audience hall contemplated how to achieve the unification of the territory a hundred years ago, a famous emperor who ruled a generation, and also abraham lincoln, the former u.s. president who wandered the dark great hall alone thinking about the integrity of the union.
yes, peace in the world is certainly dangerous, but i say to my fellow citizens, we must never exercise forbearance blindly in the name of wanting development and peace, we must never want development and peace at the expense of the nation. the boxer protocol, which is a betrayal and humiliation of the nation, has aggravated china's poverty and backwardness in modern times, and falling behind has led to bullying.
where does peace come from if there is no strength?
we must focus on national defense education, build up a great wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people, and establish a full-range, capable of attack and defense, national defense system.
the best defense is attack, and the best attack is the best defense. we should strengthen the force that can engage in an ultra-long-range attack, and improve the great combat capability in all aerospace at a great distance and depth. you should increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment, and establish high-tech elite and high-quality divisions on the premise of avoiding the influence on national economic development.
the battle horn is about to sound, people are fully equipped and ready to go.
without the support of the people, we accomplish nothing, but with their support, we are all powerful.
i say fellow citizens, it is time we said no to other people. we must achieve.
1. establish a guaranteed fund and improve the working environment and mechanisms, recruiting back to china hundreds of thousands of information technology professionals who emigrated to the united states and around the world.
2. create a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
3. manufacture 5,000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds.
4. accelerate research and deployment of high-speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles that could break through missile defense systems.
5. resume nuclear experiments, establish military forces in space.
6. retain 1,000 nuclear bombs, the equivalent of 100 million tons of trinitrotoluene, and install nuclear warheads on all short- and medium-range missiles as needed.
7. retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting three devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
8) abandon your commitment to not first use nuclear weapons.
9. retain the right of preemptive strike in the face of a threat to national security.
my fellow citizens, we can strive to be strong only if we are confident and improve ourselves. qin shi huang unified china, zheng chenggong recovered taiwan, we must carry on the far-seeing, insight and strong will of our predecessors.
that piece of land which is now trembling and moaning and calling is now shaking, fellow citizens, let us carry forward with courageous movement what the previous generals wished for but were unable to fulfill.
as i read history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmered into concern for the nation. i willingly volunteered to serve our country for the prosperity and splendor of the motherland once again, and i have no regrets even if i die. i bore the cloth gown and i am one of the common people. it is adequate for me to show my sincere and patriotic heart to heaven.
i compose poems here in the classical form of ci to voice the aspirations of my heart.
paint your lips a deep red.
protect the diaoyu islands.
we lost our ryukyu islands bitterly.
how can we allow diaoyu islands to fall into other countries?
a hundred years of vicissitude.
smoke and clouds chase the flying wave.
the youngest brother is still tender youth.
wandered all directions and bore a seal.
the flag was inspected.
we brandished our weapons and crossed the east.
let the horse drink the pacific ocean.

why didn't we fight the little japan?
what still tolerates chinese people?
they even ride our heads.
still, the gutless chinese do this?
we should tell the whole world that china can not be bullied at will.
it is time to show our strength, china has been too calm for too long.
all of our citizens' lives are currently too carefree; officials are too extravagant.
we are not cohesive already, china needs to start a war, the face of the countries that follow the us rear will be harshly slapped.
let them know that the us is not a panacea. if we win, it may increase china's influence. and improve citizen cohesion. if we lose, we can clean out the incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out. let china have new blood and be updated. get china up and running.
go china!
i suggest that china strengthen the guard of diaoyu islands, guard it every day, protect the fishermen and our country's sovereignty, if japan dares to invade our territory by military force, we will fight a small-scale war in defense regardless of the cost, china can not lose.
we need to show in life, but really, showing you are someone's embrace is p.
i just passed by.
this is how the whole society, including stars, is like.
damn, not sexy.
it is totally unacceptable.
agree, just cheap entertainers, somewhat makes sense of their reputation in feudal china.
their lives look glorious.
a group of nine professionals
life is hard.
shocked
that's normal. and whores are always heartless and unrighteous performers.
they want the money but not the face.
look at the wolf near ms. fan with glasses, you know the actor must drink with him, otherwise he will not force him out or even frame him.
son of a bitch
as long as there's something lovely to eat.
no one is easy, life is like a show, you have to look at the script to know how to perform.
all of us.
the top imperial examination scorer in all 360 life-time walks, so much effort and endeavor behind him, this humiliates the word " bean vermicelli ".
haha.
overdo.
reality
shoot that hooligan!
cheap performers
cheap performers
the entertainment circle is dirty, all men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
pity them, but who's to blame?
everybody does this, how can you make money if you don't?
when a woman is in front of others, she is proud, but when she is alone, she is melancholy.
nowadays, the stars are just popular prostitutes in ancient times, put it plainly. now they are famous prostitutes, so it is normal for them to drink or even sleep with some high officials.
stop talking to other people, just behave.
what should we do in the future? alone capabilities are not enough to succeed, are we facing such hard choices too?
the suffering is disguised as gloriousness, which is undisputable.
it's not so bad because they just play in their own circle, out of sight, out of mind.
but the old guy zhang jizhong, who behaved like a hooligan in his circle and also thought he was virtuous without talent, made a tv series when he had nothing to do to wreck the whole country's people.
both took what they needed.
when will china have a pure and innocent girl?
now the story is very shocking in the entertainment world, rumors are that hsu yuki was forced out because she refused to drink with guests arranged by the company, and had to switch to working as a lawyer's assistant to make an end meet.
the star superhero often encounters unwelcome social engagements or circumstances that he must join in.
there are many aspects and many people's interests to do with the decision, so they cann't decide on many things after all.
sometimes, the dinner parties that seem very normal to us, that we would imagine stars would have, are not that simple.
stars have lots of contracts and if they are tackled well, the source of money rolls in. if she doesn't tackle well, the force or even the frame comes to her heels.
there are two kinds of smart star females:
the second kind of person is good at playing tricks and achieving his objectives with his own seed money.
rumor has it that even some super star females have won their first roles this way.
after some drinks, the advertiser or sponsor may chance to lie on the star's shoulder, feel her chin, kiss her cheek, and the star adopts the most enduring attitude.
they are very people in 9 lower professions.
those stars just pretend, and actually live a much better life than this.
agreed, just cheap entertainment, somewhat makes sense of their reputation in feudal china.
agree.
oh well, not an easy actor.
they deserve it, they asked for it.
dawn, nothing is easy for me.
woman is a bird and a beast, and man is worse than both.

the international atomic energy agency (iaea) has reached an agreement with iranian officials stating that there are no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding iran's nuclear program and activities.
u.s. and european officials suspect that iran's civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used in the production of atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials suspect that iran's civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used in the production of atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials may impose a fourth round of sanctions against tehran when the u.n. security council is likely to consider the issue of iran's nuclear energy program in september 2007.
the international atomic energy agency distributed limited copies of a publication containing a copy of the iaea report before the 35-member board met on 11 september 2007.
the findings reflect an agreement reached between tehran and the agency on 21 august 2007, which iranian officials began publicizing the week of 12 august 2007.
the accord said that the issue of iran's nuclear program and its activities remain non-issue and ambiguity.
according to a reuters news account, the iaea report says that there has been a significant step forward in the work plan.
reuters quoted a senior u.n. official as saying that the iranian government's efforts to enrich uranium were slow.
the iaea report stated that iranian officials must continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of iran's present and future nuclear program.
iranian officials stated on august 30, 2007 that iranian officials were cooperating with the iaea in order to prevent further rounds of international sanctions.
iran's iaea representative ali asghar soltanieh stated to tehran's fars news agency that the report emphasizes that there is no sign or evidence indicating diversion of iran's nuclear activities and that all of iran's nuclear materials have been audited.
some non-proliferation experts state that the iaea has ceded too much to iran.
in a criticism published august 19, 2007 david albright and jacqueline shire of the washington-based institute for science and international security wrote that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that iranian officials will provide the iaea with access to key people, facilities and documents needed to verify answers to the iaea's questions.
independent experts stated that iran's agreement with the iaea to give inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information is the latest shortcoming in the west's demand that iran halt production of concentrated uranium which could be used in a potential nuclear bomb.
u.s. state department spokesman tom casey stated that iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program but that the report may offer some new details or insights into the development of the program.
casey stated that the nuclear program continued to move forward showing that the iranian regime continued to defy the international community.
most non-proliferation experts in the west stated that the agreement of 20070821 contained little that would dissuade policy makers in washington, london, paris and berlin from moving another round of security council sanctions forward.
experts stated that many of the transparency issues that were reportedly resolved in the agreement of 20070821 should have been previously resolved.
the agreement addresses the problem of the iranian government's pursuit of enrichment technology and capabilities, which could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material, said daryl g. kimball, executive director of the washington-based arms control association, a nonpartisan think tank.
kimball stated that the iranian government is designed to deflect criticism and pressure and claim progress is being made.
iranian officials stated that more sanctions would reduce the possibility of officials collaborating with inspectors.
the security council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on iran but the penalties demanded by the u.s. were limited due to pressure from china and russia.
soltanieh stated in an interview with iranian state-controlled television that the report and measures made any other international organization, including the security council, irrelevant and unjustified.

and proliferation, technology, international, politics
the document outlines israel's proposal to allow international organizations to transfer nuclear technology to states that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
the proposed legislation could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india to engage in nuclear trade.
israeli officials have convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines that would allow international transfer of nuclear technology to states that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
countries that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, including india, israel and pakistan, are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade, including purchases of reactors or uranium fuel or yellowcake.
in march 2007, israel distributed a document outlining israel's proposals to 45 members of the nuclear suppliers group.
the israeli presentation was made in a paper that does not allow for official denial.
the letter from the nsg chairman said that the israeli presentation was offered in the context of the nsg's debate on the indian official's bid for exemption on march 17, 2007.
only india and israel out of the non-signatories are qualified to be admitted to the nsg on the basis of their own proposals.
israel's plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-treaty states in the nuclear field.
one criterion indicates israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and says that nuclear trade should be allowed with israel provided that israel applies stringent physical protection, control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons, facilities and source materials in its territory, and to all special nuclear materials in its territory.
the document circulated on capitol hill in september 2007 as the bush administration worked toward an agreement with indian officials.
daryl kimball, executive director of the washington-based arms control association, stated that the israeli documents may affect the debate over india.
kimball stated --
the dynamic is that nsg officials do not want obstacles to the largest country and the most powerful country, india and the united states.
reaching a consensus on india at the nsg meeting in november 2007 will be difficult.
israel's proposal gave some officials reason to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
israel's record following international nuclear rules is good and better than india's record.
the bush administration rejected israeli proposals, despite the israeli government's ties to the u.s. government.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win india an exemption to engage in nuclear trade.
the pact is viewed by president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice as an important part of the foreign policy legacy of his administration.
the deal is controversial in india and congress must give its approval.
with the delay of the indian deal approval win, the government's legacy of foreign policy may be negatively affected, with the election year being the most negative.
state department spokesman tom casey stated that the u.s. government views the india deal as unique and does not see it as a precedent for any other country, including israel.
israeli embassy spokesman david siegel stated that suggestions that the israeli government is demanding exemptions or linking the effort to any other issue, including the debate over india, are grossly inaccurate.
seigel stated --
the israeli government has never asked for an exemption for israel from the nsg guidelines for nuclear supplies and has never made a specific request for israel.
recognizing israel for its full adherence to the nsg guidelines.
the israeli government urged the nsg to consider adopting a generic multi-tiered criteria-based approach to the transfer of nuclear technology.
some nsg officials previously suggested an approach similar to israel's plan.
the nsg guidelines would be considerably enhanced if the israeli proposal were to be adopted.

iran (is) - iran
and international and proliferation
ahmadinejad announced the expansion of iran's uranium production capabilities.
iran has refused to commit to a halt in expansion but hinted that a halt could be possible in the future.
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in northeastern mashhad on july 26, 2008 that iran will expand its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium to over 5,000.
ahmadinejad stated that the expansion was the first since the announcement in april 2008 that iran had approached implementing 6000 centrifuges.
iran has articulated the goal of 50,000 centrifuges operating at an enrichment plant near natanz.
the international community has demanded that iran halt nuclear material production.
the media reports differ from the number of centrifuges cited by ahmadinejad.
iranian news agencies reported that ahmadinejad stated that iran had 6000 working centrifuges, but subsequently removed the statement from the internet.
another iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100,000 centrifuges.
experts discount significance of ahmadinejad's claims because of the absence of information on the functionality of the centrifuges.
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity in tehran stated that the number of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines operate and are efficient but that ahmadinejad's assertions hinder resolution to the diplomatic standoff between iran and the west.
the new america foundation's arms control expert jeffrey g. lewis stated that the think tank is aware of iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but is not aware of the status of the machines' operational status.
diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems hinder iran's enrichment program.
iran repeated its assertion that its nuclear program aims only to produce electricity as producing nuclear weapons contradicts islamic principles.
the us, israel, europe and the majority of western arms control experts believe that iran is pursuing the capability to produce a bomb immediately if it decides to do so.
experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple.
ahmadinejad stated that the west is still pursuing the resumption of negotiations after iran resisted western demands to halt its nuclear activities.
the eu's foreign policy chief javier solana recently presented iran with two offers.
a package of incentives to cease production of enriched uranium endorsed by the us.
during the six-week freeze period, iran did not add centrifuges and the west refrained from promoting a fourth round of economic sanctions against iran to the un security council.
us officials repeated their statement that negotiations cannot begin before iran halts all enrichment-related activities that can be verified, but the bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze and dispatched burns to geneva.
iran refused to respond to solana's offer on 26 july 2008 at talks in geneva attended by us undersecretary of state for political affairs william j. burns.
the talks constituted the highest level of diplomatic contact between the us and iran in nearly 30 years.
solana, burns and the european envoy set a deadline for a positive iranian response before initiating new sanctions, including a prohibition on selling iranian refined petroleum products, vital to its economy.
iranian officials refused to commit to stopping the expansion or observing deadlines.
on 26 july 2008 ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that iran could potentially halt the expansion over a six week period at a higher number of centrifuges than previously expected.
ahmadinejad stated that the west consented to the existing and operating centrifuges of between 5000 and 6000 if the number of centrifuges would not increase.
5000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear material to make a power plant or an atomic bomb if highly enriched.
6000 centrifuges running continuously could produce weapons-grade uranium for a single bomb in six months.
in may 2008 the international atomic energy agency stated that iran possessed 3500 operating centrifuges.

the paris diplomatic meeting concluded without further agreement on steps to pressure iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility.
diplomats stated on november 14, 2008 that officials from the united states, europe, russia and china had not reached agreement at a meeting on november 13, 2008 in paris to further act to persuade iran to halt uranium enrichment at iran's natanz facility.
a highly technical process of uranium enrichment that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants or fissile material for atomic weapons.
the meeting ended on 13 november 2008 without new measures announced.
the french foreign ministry released a statement after the 13 november 2008 meeting declaring that the international community reaffirms the importance of the dual-track approach of engaging diplomatically with iran and working towards sanctions.
russia and china resist new sanctions on iran.
russia and china are tied closely politically and economically with iran and feel no domestic pressure to act against iran.
the united states is not closely tied to the islamic republic of iran politically and economically and feels domestic pressure to act against iran.
russia and china hold veto power over security council decisions.
according to interfax news agency in moscow, russian diplomat sergei ryabkov said that at the meeting on november 13, 2008, the parties did not strike a deal on iranian sanctions, western countries favor sanctions, but china and russia do not support sanctions.
sergei ryabkov attended the meeting on 13 november 2008.
a report released this week stated that iran has made significant progress on a heavy water research reactor facility near arak.
the iranian heavy water research reactor near arak may eventually be able to produce plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons.
satellite images published by the institute for science and international security show significant progress in the construction of the heavy water research reactor facility near arak between february 2008 and october 2008.
david albright stated that the iranian heavy water research reactor near arak has evaded notice by the international security community.
david albright stated that satellite images said that the iranian heavy water research reactor near arak has made significant progress and that the reactor has progressed from the building frame to a large finished facility in the past 1.5 years.
david albright is a former arms inspector and is the director of the washington, d.c.-based institute for science and international security.
iran states that it is pursuing nuclear technology for energy production and research.
the united states and western allies suspect that iran's nuclear production efforts preceded the creation of nuclear weapons infrastructure.
low-grade uranium can be legally produced under international arms control regulations.
iran's latest development of nuclear technology shows the incoming foreign policy team of us president-elect barack obama a complex and technical challenge of taking on the task of stopping iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
the administration of us president george w. bush managed to synchronize us policy with the leaders of the european union, great britain, france and germany in the last month in which it was in power to press for tougher sanctions against iran and diplomatic action.
the international atomic energy agency is expected to release a report next week that will criticize iran.
the international atomic energy agency is a united nations nuclear watchdog agency.
the new initiative on the iranian nuclear program did not emerge from the paris talks on 13 november 2008, decreasing hopes that another set of united nations security council sanctions would be imposed before the end of president bush's term.
while maneuvering diplomatically, iran continues to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology.
some israeli officials stated that they were alarmed by iran's tests this week of two-stage solid-fuel rockets with a range of 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers).
tel aviv is less than 650 miles from iranian territory.

a russian high-security laboratory complex that stores anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria faces losing electricity because it lacks payment to the electricity utility mosenergo.
a large repository of deadly pathogens including anthrax, plague and other bacteria is threatened by loss of electricity, stored in a high-security russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of moscow.
officials from the moscow region electricity utility mosenergo recently arrived at the russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity due to lack of payment.
the russian laboratory complex is a campus of 90 buildings and served as the location of a secret biological weapons program during the soviet era.
the incorrect headline in izvestia stated that a deadly virus from the moscow regional depository threatened moscow.
the virus is not at the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
at the state scientific center of applied microbiology, every kind of bacterium was being studied for use in the soviet union's secret biological weapons program, deadly.
there is a large viral repository in siberia.
russian and western officials stated that the power cutoff at the state scientific center of applied microbiology was unlikely to result in any threat to public health.
russian and western officials stated that there is not enough certainty to know why the loss of power at the state scientific center of applied microbiology posed a public health threat.
general nikolai n. urakov stated by telephone that the state scientific center of applied microbiology has a quite reliable system of protection in emergency.
nikolai n. urakov, longtime director of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the state scientific center of applied microbiology is working with western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedicine manufacturing site.
general nikolai n. urakov stated by telephone that the people of the state scientific center of applied microbiology are scared by this threat of sudden electricity shutdown, because of the kind of psychological pressure it puts on them.
general nikolai n. urakov stated by telephone that if the power is shut down at the state scientific center of applied microbiology, scientists must destroy all bacteriological experiments under way.
general nikolai n. urakov likes that the united states and western countries are contributing about 6 million us dollars a year to transform the former bioweapons complex and that another 500,000 us dollars a year is being paid to the electric bills and arrears of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
american scientists working closely with the state scientific center of applied microbiology stated that the russian government is responsible for paying the research institute's electric bills.
in 1997, western aid to convert one of general nikolai n. urakov's bioweapons laboratories peaked because it was learned that iran had offered to purchase research experts from the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the crisis is being orchestrated by russian scientists and military leaders who are now dependent on western financing to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, in order to increase financing.
american scientist randall lee beatty is working to convert the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity at the state scientific center of applied microbiology is a crisis.
randall lee beatty is the director of the international science and technology center.
general nikolai n. urakov was financed by the international science and technology center to the tune of approximately half of his budget to support about 350 russian biowarfare scientists and technicians.
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific center of applied microbiology knew for 14 months that the center's electricity bills were not being paid.
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific center of applied microbiology is the most important location in the world for archiving dangerous pathogens and is a shame to be destroyed because of non-payment of electricity utilities.
the bacteria are stored at the state scientific center of applied microbiology, and many of them are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen, isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversized air-handling systems, all of which depend on electricity for functioning.
defrosting frozen live germs is the greatest danger, as the electric power is shut down at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
biological warfare expert raymond zilinskas of the monterey institute of international studies stated that the main threat to the organism is the cut of power to the state scientific center of applied microbiology instead of the possibility of escape.
raymond zilinskas stated that in the worst case bacteria would be defrosted at -70 degrees and that the cleanup afterward would be a real mess because it was not certain that all the bacteria would die.
another example is the confrontation between the electricity utility mosenergo and the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk, where the basic capitalist imperative of enterprise self-sustainment dangerously clashed with the old things that remain from soviet-era science.
the russian national power company cut off electricity at a strategic base where nuclear missiles stand on high alert because of an overdue power bill in 2000.
nuclear missile silos do not lose power.
armed troops marched to the substation and turned the power back on.
the national company united energy systems cut power in january and february 2001 at a number of military installations around russia.
the kamchatka monitoring center for the russian space forces is one of the military installations that has lost power.
in most cases where military installations have been cut off from electricity, it is quickly restored.
investigations often show that the utility and military are at war, with the military forcing the utility to spend budget funds on electric power instead of diverting money to other useful things.
some budget funds are cut at times for building a residence in the country for generals.

brazil has implemented a law that allows the air force to target drug trafficking aircraft in brazilian airspace.
the us is concerned about liability in the event of misidentification of civilian planes.
brazil announced that the air force has begun shooting down aircraft used in illegal drug trafficking in brazilian airspace.
the plan requires eight precautionary steps before an order to shoot down a plane can be issued.
prior to the policy taking effect in late 2004, the publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they needed to file flight plans.
the law permitting such actions was originally approved in 1998 but president fernando henrique cardoso never put the policy into effect from 1995 to 2003.
the united states dissuaded cardoso from signing the decree because the united states was concerned that the accidental downing of a civilian aircraft could expose the united states government and companies to lawsuits.
in april 2001 the united states reduced its support for operations targeting drug-running aircraft when a peruvian jet shot down and killed a us missionary and her child, misidentifying the small plane as a drug carrier.
relatives of victims have sued the us government and won settlements from it for providing intelligence and technical support for the operation.
a us state department official stated --
under certain conditions, us law could forbid assistance to countries implementing the shoot-down law.
the us agreed with brazil's assessment that the threat from drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
the us government consulted the brazilian government on brazilian law provisions.
brazilian defense minister jose viegas stated that brazil is encountering difficulties in securing us support for the plan but recent bilateral talks have led to certainty that the brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing brazil to commercial sanctions.
brazilian officials expressed hopeful that the us would endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
the us is scheduled to provide brazil with 10.2 million dollars in drug aid and law enforcement aid in 2004.
former air force chief and current director of the air institute of the estacio de sa university in rio de janeiro, general mauro jose miranda gandra stated that the government has taken courageous steps but the impact may be more political than practical because of the restrictions imposed by the brazilian government.
brazilian officials stated that the policy may not apply to aircraft with children on board.
viegas stated that limits are needed.
gandra stated that the provisions undermine the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug-smuggling aircraft that carry children, thus introducing the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
viegas stated in an interview in brasilia that the government is using the law more powerfully to dissuade drug traffickers who previously felt no threat from the air force from entering brazil's airspace.
the deterioration of the public security situation in sao paolo and particularly rio de janeiro, where powerful and increasingly violent drug gangs are active, has prompted the government to act.
drug gangs in rio de janeiro have more firepower than the police, have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close.
president luiz inacio lula da silva stated in an interview with a foreign correspondent in 2003.
the policy is about national sovereignty and national security.
some pilots of drug-running aircraft felt so confident of immunity from retribution that they made obscene gestures to the brazilian air force pilots in pursuit.
the law is a constitutional question under brazil's prohibition of death penalties for criminal acts.
some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounts to a de facto execution of drug traffickers, contrary to government claims.
the o estado de sao paolo daily newspaper stated in an editorial during the week of july 18-24, 2004 that extreme measures raise problems of ethics and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefits.
people are extrajudicially penalized by the application of administrative decisions by air force commanders.
these people gain the power of life and death over the crew and non-regular flyers.
in 2002 brazil inaugurated the radar system sivam at a cost of 140 million dollars allowing the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive amazon for the first time.
the system uses american technology.
illegal flights declined initially by 30 percent due to concerns that improved tracking capabilities would be a concern for traffickers, but subsequently reaccelerated.
brazil recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003.
some of these flights are innocent violations by ranchers flying between plantations in the amazon.
viegas stated that there has been a significant increase in deliberate violations of brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who apparently realize that the government is incapable of retaliation.
in april 2001, fernandinho beira-mar, rio de janeiro's most notorious drug trafficking boss, was captured in colombia, in a gun-for-drugs pipeline involving left-wing guerrillas.
the northern amazon corridor of brazil has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
reportedly runs a route through colombia and suriname across the northern tier of the amazon.
colombia is the only country currently with a policy targeting drug trafficking aircraft.
colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the united states.

international; weapons; leaders; military
the venezuelan president's dealings with russia on weapons, curbs on military cooperation with the united states and plans to train as many as 2 million venezuelan civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion have worried venezuela and its domestic critics.
venezuelan president hugo chavez's dealings with russia over weapons, curtailing military cooperation with russia and plans to train as many as 2 million civilians to repel an imperialist superpower invasion have worried the united states and chavez's domestic critics over what they see as a leftist former military officer's plan.
chavez insisted the move was purely defensive and overdue given the need to update obsolete military hardware and protect venezuela from nations that might want to control it.
venezuela is the state that produces the most petroleum in south america.
domestic opponents of chavez scoff at the idea of a us invasion of venezuela and charge that his true intention is to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists to protect against any internal rising and to pose a military counterweight to us influence in latin america.
fidel castro, the leader of cuba, is a major ally of chavez and the two have grown closer.
chavez's detractors in the us government say that chavez's strategy of restructuring venezuelan democracy through an image of militarized socialism in the cuban style, and purchasing arms and indoctrinating civilian militias, could even more troubledly foment a leftist revolution throughout south america.
us strategists said they were increasingly concerned about the potential for such a revolution to be fomented by radical moves inspired by chavez.
latin american politics has shifted leftward since the late 1990 s.
the perceived failure of free market economics has largely been the cause of this leftward shift.
leftists elected to lead brazil, argentina, chile, uruguay, ecuador and venezuela.
chavez supporters at home counter that the united states has a long history of open and covert armed intervention in latin america's domestic politics and say the united states has no right to question venezuela's defense preparations.
carlos roque espinoza leon said venezuelans never asked what the us marines did.
chavez's favorite, espinoza leon, is a specialist in defense in venezuela's national assembly.
espinoza said peru has 500,000 rifles and no one says anything.
espinoza said no one complains that colombia is the most militarized country in latin america.
espinoza said the us history is full of aggression in latin america.
espinoza said venezuelans must do whatever is necessary to protect the country.
chavez, in his famous statement, said the so-called bolivarian revolution in venezuela was peaceful but armed.
chavez was first elected in 1998 and according to an independent poll by datanalisis, his popularity rating was 71 %.
venezuelan military analyst alberto garrido said chavez is looking to allies in russia, china and iran to promote a multi-polar world that will counteract us dominance and encourage grass-roots movements in latin america to throw off the influence of governments in the region.
lorenzo campos, a farmer in the northern venezuelan state of anzoategui and a reservist.
campos said the venezuelans want the world to know that they are not preparing an attack on anyone and that the mission is for the protection of venezuela.
in may 2005 chavez's government announced details of a deal with a russian firm to purchase 100,000 ak-103 assault rifles each with 30 rounds of ammunition for 18.6 million dollars and the transfer of technology to venezuela to manufacture the rifles.
the deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle.
this price is considerably less than the $ 825 - $ 850 price for the same weapon ordered via the us mails.
the venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 helicopters from russia, 10 transport planes from spain and 6 naval craft from russia.
venezuelan officials said the government is negotiating with brazil to buy around 24 air and train planes.
chavez insisted and even his most staunch military critics here agreed that the purchase was essential to update the military's decades-old weapons, such as the fal rifles from belgium.
retired general fernando ochoa antich said that statements that chavez is engaged in an arms buildup are exaggerated.
ochoa was defense minister in 1992 when then lieutenant colonel chavez launched a failed coup.
ochoa stated that venezuela had not purchased arms in the past 25 years and said chavez had not bought weapons aggressively or threateningly towards his neighbors.
ochoa said venezuela never bought arms from russia before and suggested chavez bought arms to become independent of the us.
ochoa asked why chavez was buying a rifle caliber popular with subversive forces in latin america and stated that chavez's political support for radical leftist movements made him a menace to the continent.
the us pentagon has openly questioned what chavez is doing with the old fal rifles and whether he is sharing weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in latin america.
the us government has provided no evidence that chavez is arming or funding leftist insurgencies.
a military analyst who specializes in the farc said the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and are not interested in old rifles from belgium or chavez's assistance.
a study published in 2003 by the us defense intelligence agency reported that more than half of the weapons seized from colombian guerrillas marked as foreign military originated in venezuela.
implies that corrupt or sympathetic venezuelan military members could aid the guerrillas.
it is possible that the ideological military and civilian reservist training that critics say chavez is mindful of could be more distressing to domestic chavez opponents.
chavez so called for the revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist the superpower aggressor earlier in 2005 and said that the first step in resistance would be to train up to 2 million volunteers in the coming years to back up the active duty armed forces.
military analysts estimate venezuela's active duty armed forces number 83,000.
people have created their own defense units in neighborhoods, state companies and the free university established under chavez and report directly to the president.
the government insists that the reserve supports the armed forces and will not act against a fifth column against chavez in case of a possible coup against chavez.
espinoza said that reserves should not be used for shock troops against any political party and that each person would decide which side to be on in a civil war.
general julio ramon quintero viloria is a reserve commander.
quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians in the second half of 2005 over the next 20 weekends and that they could train 300,000 more civilians in 2006.
quintero said the venezuelans do not want any empire's colony and are ready for any possibility.
in june 2005, 100,000 reservists and the venezuelan navy engaged in a massive war game to repel an invading stronger country.
in june 2005, 40 employees of the state oil company participated in a similar exercise with 1200 soldiers.
here, chavez's pro-chavez circle warns of asymmetrical warfare.
asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by us strategists to describe conflicts between unequal combatants in which the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
the us government has given colombia 3.3 billion dollars in military aid over the past five years.
chavez loyalists fear the us government could instigate a proxy war between colombia and venezuela in order to oust chavez and control venezuela's oil.
in an interview, a senior us official dismissed the notion that the us government wanted to invade venezuela as completely and utterly nonsensical.
officials said the chavez side wishes to make a negative relationship because it calculates politically that mr. chavez will reach power constantly confronting the us.
another troubling development is chavez's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises.
the us military has had a cooperation office in fort venezuela for 50 years.
chavez shut it down in 2004.
the five us military trainees and students participating in the exchange program were ordered to leave the country by april 2005.
analysts say chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
analysts said chavez has not proven the use of that force to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere.

the north korean government may be preparing to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in june 2007 in the first step toward disabling it by december 2007.
on june 18, 2007, christopher hill, the assistant secretary of state, stated that the north korean government could be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in steps toward disabling it by december 2007.
hill is the head negotiator for the united states in the north korean nuclear weapons program.
hill stated that the stalled dismantlement effort of north korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of june 16-17, 2007 when international atomic energy agency inspectors invited by pyongyang officials to talk about verification and monitoring of the shutdown.
hill stated that the long anticipated shutdown would follow talks with chinese negotiator wu dawei.
hill stated that it could be shut down within a week but not within a month.
the associated press reported on 18 june 2007 from vienna, austria that the iaea stated that a team will visit pyongyang on 24 june 2007 to discuss the manner of inspectors' verification of the shutdown.
hill stated that iaea inspectors held talks with pyongyang officials on the sealing of reactors, including the installation of television monitors at the site.
north korean officials refused to proceed with an agreement to begin decommissioning the yongbyon reactor in february 2007 until 25 million dollars in funds held in accounts linked to north korea in macao banks were transferred to north korea.
money was frozen when us officials accused banco delta asia of complicity in north korean financial crimes.
the funds were wired to the new york federal reserve bank on june 14, 2007, after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds.
the fund is supposed to be sent to russia's central bank before the transfer to the north korean government's account at a russian commercial bank.
hill stated that talks on steps to recoup time lost during the financial transfer negotiations would take place with russian, south korean and japanese disarmament negotiators in the week of 17 june 2007.
also involved in the discussions is setting a timetable for resuming talks between the 6 nations on arms control.
under an agreement reached in february 2007, north korean officials pledged to shut down the yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for 50,000 tons of fuel oil shipments.
in the next phase of the agreement, north korean officials declared an all-nuclear program and disabled all facilities in return for further 950,000 tons of fuel oil.
hill stated that the next phase of the agreement could be concluded by december 2007.

the official website of iraq's top shiite religious leader grand ayatollah ali al-sistani was defaced and blocked from cyber attacks motivated by sectarianism.
it is not clear when the attacks began on 18 september 2008 or 19 september 2008 morning.
al-sistani's website was offline on september 19, 2008 evening.
another website related to one of al-sistani's religious organizations, www.al-shia.com, was also affected.
the alternative address www.sistani.com is still operational.

somali pirates who hijacked a ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms are approaching a deal to release the ship.
questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms through the kenyan route and possible clandestine arms deals between kenya and south sudan.
maritime officials and associates of the somali pirates who hijacked a ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms on 25 september 2008 stated on 8 october 2008 that the pirates could collect their ransom soon.
after difficult negotiations likened by several involved in the bazaar-style haggling, the parties were close to reaching a deal in which pirates would be paid millions of dollars and ships would be freed.
businessman ahmed omar in xarardheere, somalia stated that pirates have agreed to a ransom of approximately 8 million u.s. dollars to ship owners and the ship could be freed on 08 october 08 or 09 october 08.
xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on somalia's coast.
kenyan maritime officials stated that there is yet to be an agreement on critical details.
one such detail involves pirates requesting a guarantee that the armada of united states warships currently encircling the pirates will not arrest or attack them.
a kenyan maritime official anonymously stated that such negotiations are complex and involve more than just financial aspects.
officials stated on 8 october 2008 that progress was being made and that the parties were approaching an agreement.
the pirates initially requested 35 million u.s. dollars and then reduced it to 20 million u.s. dollars.
the pirates consistently expressed a willingness to negotiate financial figures.
more than 25 ships were hijacked off the coast of somalia in 2008, typically ransoming the ships for between $ 1,000 and $ 2 million in u.s. dollars.
pirates who boarded a ukrainian ship stated that the ship and its cargo and the 20 sailors on board would be released upon receiving payment of 1000 us dollars and the pirates preferred a 100000 us dollar bill.
the question is what country the arms were originally destined for, which was boarded by a ukrainian ship.
shortly after the 20080925 hijacking of a freighter, the kenyan government claimed that the weapons were being shipped to the kenyan military.
ships via the main kenyan port of mombasa.
the weapons on board included 33 t-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
subsequently, evidence emerged of kenya's clandestine arms dealing with the separatist regions of southern sudan.
if the pirates did not hijack the ship and did not begin speaking to the media via satellite phone, the deal is most likely to remain secret.
ukrainian officials are adamant in their denial of any wrongdoing.
ukrainian diplomat oleh belokolos in kenya stated --
ukraine has not supplied any arms to the government of south sudan and has no plans to do so.
all appropriate paperwork was validated.
ukraine abides by all united nations rules and agreements on arms control.
ukraine inherited an enormous stockpile of weaponry after the collapse of the soviet union and now deals in major arms.
the deal with ukraine is considered suspicious because kenya relies most on the united kingdom and other western countries for heavy weapons supplies.
kenyan politicians have demanded answers and called on several commissions to examine the situation.
southern sudan is an autonomous region, currently increasing its military, using soviet-designed tanks.
the united states military stated that it would prioritize ensuring that the ship does not unload weapons and that the weapons are not sold to islamist insurgents in somalia.
pirates denied any interest in weapons and claimed they were unaware tanks were among the cargo when they hijacked the ship.
pirate spokesman sugule ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates are solely interested in the money from the deal.

costa said this to reporters last week as the u.n. drug office prepared to release its latest survey of afghanistan's opium crop.
the survey showed that poppy cultivation has retreated much in afghanistan and is overwhelmingly concentrated in the 7 provinces where the insurgency remains strongest, most of which are in the south.
the survey was issued on 27 november 2008.
the united nations found that the amount of land devoted to opium in afghanistan was reduced by 19 % despite a total drop in opium production of just 6 %.
the study stated that a high output per acre is attributed to a good growing season in the south.
the southern region is an area of heavy irrigation where the taliban maintain a strong presence in five provinces and systematically encourage opium cultivation to finance their insurgency for several years.
the u.n. estimates that insurgents made much of the $ 3 billion in opium trade last year.
costa said a lot of the war effort could be funded with billions of dollars.
the taliban produced an amount of opium that far exceeded world demand for three successive bumper crop years.
costa said the result was a glut that depressed prices which dropped approximately 20 percent.
costa said the price collapse had already taken place and that the taliban, drug lords and even some farmers were stockpiling opium.
the increased amounts are also processed in afghanistan.
costa added that insurgents were holding a significant amount of opium.
costa said the surplus was as much as 11,000 tons (22,000 metric tons) and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
the united nations found that afghanistan produced 8,500 tons of opium in 2008.
the world's demand is estimated at about 4400 tons per year.
the taliban stood passive to cultivation this year and less pressured afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
then this supports the current price.
costa is a six-year veteran of the u.n. office on drugs and crime, serving as an italian diplomat.

hong kong police are trying to prevent triads or transnational criminal syndicates from engaging in criminal activities.
hong kong police recently smashed a transnational theft syndicate specializing in exploiting youngsters to commit various crimes, a cross-boundary criminal syndicate specializing in the triad gangs and a local triad gang specializing in theft.
the oriental daily news opined that hong kong police's recent efforts to cut down 5 of so-called triad branch leaders or district team leaders within 3 weeks of a short period demonstrated that the police were determined to eradicate criminal activities.
hong kong police have recently worked closely with the public security bureau in guangdong province to exchange intelligence and carried out a series of raids and operations.
hong kong police cracked down on triad activities including drug trafficking, illegal possession of arms, theft, burglary, robbery, selling pirated and obscene recordings, and duty-free cigarettes from 18 july to 24 july 2002.
it was reported that on 24 july 2002 police dispatched over 100 staff to storm a propitiatory dance and wine party organized in a disco nightclub in mongkok, kowloon, to settle some disputes between two triad groups.
police eventually arrested three branch leaders and 14 core triad members.
a police source confirmed to xinhua news agency on july 25, 2002 that all 17 arrested persons were still under questioning.
according to a hong kong police source, the operation succeeded in netting all 17 people, resulting from police efforts to infiltrate relevant gangs here.
police sources also intimated that the hong kong police's crackdown on other triad gangs would follow.
the hong kong police will involve police in the mainland of china and police in other regions in active cooperation in the hong kong police's efforts to fight off criminal organizations.

peruvian military documents disclosed a link between former intelligence head montesinos and drug trafficking.
the document, signed by a former high-ranking peruvian army officer and disclosed on july 25, 2002, mentions links between drug trafficking and may compromise further the situation of former head of peru's national intelligence service vladimiro montesinos.
according to the front page story of el comercio, peru's national daily newspaper, montesinos may have authorized the drug dealing of the leaders of the military in the alto huallaga region in order to find the leaders of the shinning path rebel group and the tupac amaru revolutionary movement.
the alto huallaga is located northeast of the capital lima.
the story is based on a final report from the attorney general's office.
the attorney general's office collected the accusatory documents handed over by an unnamed peruvian army general.
el comercio said the then president alberto fujimori put the scorpion intelligence operation into effect in 1992 to fight off terrorism and drug trafficking in the amazon.
several agents infiltrated the group as part of the planned scorpion operation to gather information on the main rebel and drug trafficking commanders.
the additional order was for the transportation of cocaine, which was to cover up the agent.
montesinos was a close advisor to former peruvian president alberto fujimori.
fujimori resigned in november over a bribery scandal and is now imprisoned in lima on alleged connections to the scandal.

russian space forces commander lieutenant general vladimir popovkin reportedly said that chirac and putin said that expanding russia-france space cooperation is a priority.
france is the leading country in the european space agency.
chirac visits as the russian government displays unease over nato's latest expansion to its borders and the imminent enlargement of the european union into the former soviet sphere of influence in eastern europe.
at a press conference following the meeting, putin said that russia's activities to defend national security were not aggressive and were not targeted at anyone.
the titov space center is a military facility and is run and operated by the russian space forces under tight security.
putin said that chirac's visit there indicated that russia was developing the most advanced weapons systems but that russia found it possible to acquaint its partner france with this project.
putin stressed that this points out russian transparency and openness on security matters.

i am 24 years old and my mother is 2.5 years old.
i have been broken up with my son's father since august.
i want to start dating other people and my son's father says if i do that i have nothing to do with him.
he is very possessive and controlling but he has no right to be because we are together.
he's going on too much in his life right now and thinks we can work, even though i've told him several times that i don't love him and he doesn't love me.
i want him there for his son, but not too much so that he needs me.
but he has no one, his family doesn't get along with him and they have issues with him.
i don't want to be miserable anymore and i'd be more miserable if he was around longer.
i don't want him there for his son, because he's a good father or at least tries to be.
i believe every child needs both parents, whether they are together or not.
but he thinks that if he can't have me, no one can.
what am i doing with my life?
it's very bad to threaten you with your son using your ex-significant other.
you have to give in to that, it just escalates if you give in to that.
you have the right to live your life and be happy, so don't cave in to his threats.
he would see them regardless if he really loved his son, but this is just a typical method of control used by people like him.
other people say things like " if you leave me, i'll kill myself " does it get through to you?
date it!
meet all kinds of people.
do what you want to do.
if the price of walking out of your both lives was that he volunteered to walk out of his, you'd probably be better off without him.
i agree, one other thing, if you date or don't date him, that's his business.
i didn't tell him.
he's not threatening, he's not concerned about your personal life.
can you document his threats?
you really need to...
quit taking his calls and make him leave voice mail.
make him email or text you.
keep that record.
get a lawyer and divorce.
try to get legal aid if you can't afford one.
tell your ex-significant other that all communications need to go through a lawyer.
the bus driver, the person tilling the field, the person delivering your food wants the exact change.
don't they realize you don't get a change pile from the bank?
should someone take notes somewhere?
people get lazy.
i'd like to be as near as possible, i don't like counting copper all day.
if you take a twenty pound note on the bus, they'll just tell you to get the bus, because they're hell of a lazy.
it is illegal to pay a certain amount in coins, for example you can only pay 30 pence in pennies.
hello, i started university in september but obviously i haven't gelled with it immediately like most people.
but i know that my adjustment is going to take some time, because i am very introverted, shy, especially anxious and all rest.
and on the first night i was here, all my housemates went out and i did, and it was the hardest thing i've ever had to do.
i go to the student union bar by myself when i'm sober.
here's the fact: but more to the point.
i didn't enjoy university after being here for about 5 months. the course disillusioned me and i didn't enjoy the set project and i didn't like the delivery of the course much.
the university made out much better than it seemed.
i started the first term badly, student finance was delayed adding to the level of stress i was under and so i was so worried that i was unable to progress with my work, in the end it was all a pile.
i was assigned a university counselor and saw him in block sessions for about 5-6 weeks and if i'm being honest, it didn't really work out because i never opened up to him.
only half a heart.
i'm loaded to the neck with work now, have to hit a major deadline, depressed and anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time.
i no longer have a counselor because you can only have so many sessions at a time and i doubt that it would help me much at this time if i already have help.
i lacked motivation, i didn't feel comfortable with my lecturer, i felt like i wanted to give in but i couldn't bring myself to do it because i ended up with a dead-end job and aspired to be someone.
i'd rather die than be uneducated and not live the life i want to live, and i'm worsening the matter by dropping out of university.
i am 21 years old and i turn 22 this year, i have no time to fail and i have to do something.
i failed college once and did another course so i could get into university.
maybe someone can advise me?
and maybe you can go and see your doctor and see if there is any way to get an extension on your deadline to try and ease the pressure a bit.
send your tutor an email like this post, and consider the mitigating circumstances. don't worry, they've seen all sorts of admissions that are much more uncomfortable to look at. i know, i work in the university administration.
break your work into manageable chunks.
concentrate on one bit of work at a time (obviously the most urgent assignment first).
don't shut off your housemates, do well because you're trying new things from the very beginning, keep it now.
i would recommend you go for a check up too, see your doctor.
speaking to someone can be beneficial if you are always anxious, my friend got therapy from the nhs because of anxiety, it's really normal.
try to get an extension, if you're honest i'm sure your university will allow it.
it's hard to keep strong and keep on living.
my mum got divorced, she had a horrible time with my stepfather and when she found her freedom she sent her round the bend.
she has epilepsy and manic depression with a huge anger problem.
she is constantly horrible to me.
i cann't cope with her outbursts and the hateful nasty remarks she makes when i'm at home.
i am an 18 year old person with a 95 % bursary studying full time in a high pressure private school in 6 th form at the point of my break.
i cann't work from home because she shouts at me.
then i got angry at my teacher because...
she was lovely in one minute, like i had my mummy back, and then the next minute she turned into the most spiteful living human.
i didn't pass my a2 exams and i've already accepted that i've been defeated and this year of my life has made me a failure.
i don't know if i can come back, but the university offered me the most amazing offer, but i couldn't even accept it. i never made a grade.
i wish i could wipe her out from my life, things would be so much better without her.
but then i think i'm just selfish.
but surely that doesn't mean i'm living like this, does it?
it's so much better, it's a must have.
but i feel like i have no control over this downward spiral.
and i don't know what to do.
thank you for reading.
nice vent.
you cann't get a section on her for that.
even does she have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis?
you sure don't know that you won't get a good grade, so you accept the place if you can.
life will throw things at you all the time.
outsiders are people who are not members of your family.
i had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for 8 years before i came to university and honestly, i'm here because that's the only way out for it.
if you really want out, work hard.
really, if she cann't give you consistent support, you need support from somewhere else.
can you call childline or something like that?
you can go to the library on saturday and study there for 8 hours good.
can you go to your friend's house to form a study group?
she's sectioned because her arse is a bit painful and you're blaming her for all your problems?
i know how you feel.
my mum spits from hell too.
i highly recommend taking up smoking.
oh, tsr grew up and stopped nagging, it's a joke.
i think i became much weaker and duller in my personality way between a year and two years ago, trying to befriend some people at the university.
but being overly nice leads people to believe that they can say whatever they want to you and do whatever they want to you.
they showed no absolute respect.
so i say hello to someone from the university and they ignore me, but 30 minutes later they decide they want my help with some work and i give it to them.
it made me angry and distressed in my life and it really started to affect my concentration at university.
anyone got any experience of handling this sort of thing, or how to go about getting some respect back again?
just say no.
do it gradually if it's not particularly comfortable.
sorry i cann't, i'm busy.
of course, you don't go over the top with it, you don't go in the completely opposite direction.
if you think no, say no, mind you.
they start respecting you more when they start realizing you are not going to bend over backwards for them.
this is really well, such a bad attitude, you can't be respected if you're nice but not nice enough to let them do anything to you, of course, that's not nice, but that's a foolish person.
i don't know if anyone has read this, but i just feel despairing and i feel like i need to tell someone.
i left home in september and started university, i was incredibly anxious about doing this but i delayed thinking about it until i got here, i'm here now and have been for over two weeks, i feel overwhelmed by it all and feel i'm not intelligent and socially awkward.
since moving to secondary school i have had roughly 15 months of counselling, i lost my dad around the age of 9 and always blamed it on how i felt, i have had 2 periods of counselling in my life, one from december 2009 to this year around march.
i feel like i'm having a moment where i'm overwhelmed by the problems of my life and i'm making myself doubt my always low self esteem more and more and i'm not able to concentrate on work and i find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions and i'm doubting myself about anything and everything.
however, my two counselors did not diagnose me with depression and suggested i was not suffering from it, but i was huge worried about depression because of the depression that caused my dad to die and his suicide.
i tried to solve my problems before, and found particular exercise and meditation useful, and also tried things like self-help books and tapes, but generally speaking, i felt this was not the way to live, i was wasting one chance of my existence, one chance of being a young man.
and i simply don't know what to do, and i never follow through when i think about what i'm going to do, my friends often say i'm lazy, and i can't disagree a lot of the time, i feel like they're trying everything they can to help, and i fail, time and time again.
sorry to anyone who read this jumbled mess, but i feel a bit like a self-seeking moaner, but i'm truly desperate.
it is common for people to become more intensely self-conscious when they are in a new situation and feel pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into a new role, such as a university student.
i am not a professional in healthy, i can only speak from my own experience, so i would strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your depression and worries.
most people feel stupid and awkward when they get to university, so you're definitely not alone there. i would really recommend getting an appointment with the counselling service at your university, but that's up to you. really, it doesn't matter what anyone tells you, whether you're depressed or not. it's not really a matter of telling anyone, it's a matter of having some problems, obviously, and having some support. you have some problems, obviously, and you can have some support. it's not as important as your experience, but it's really helpful to meditate and exercise, so try to do that. but you have to engage with help and generally with life, to get somewhere. a lot of people feel like this, and hopefully it will pass when you start to feel better. don't be hard on yourself, that's only going to make you feel worse. be kind to yourself and get some help.
good luck.
i think a lot more people feel the same way as you do, but they medicate themselves using their friends, but that probably isn't the solution as such, but definitely being around your friends when you're depressed is better than being alone and depressed, if you fancy a chat either way, feel free to message me privately.
if you were me, i'd focus on idol. you aspire to be someone like someone who comes from a bad background and ends up succeeding, happy, having a family, marrying, etc. but you don't want to be them, you want to admire and respect them.
focus on what you have achieved in life, not what you are studying or indeed why you are studying. you want to experience it, your mum wants you to go, you need a degree for the career you want.
you sum up why you are there and work your butt off to get the best grade you can, either way you have something to say like " hey i didn't fail, i worked hard and passed" when you get your degree.

i hope this helps.
i'm not autistic pretty much, i'm not diagnosed with dyspraxia but i think it's a misdiagnosis by the doctors, but i walk on my toes nearly all the time.
it's more comfortable for me.
who makes the decision that a toe walk is an autism sign, when it seems so random and never indicates autism?
well, i can have something that is a sign of something on the autism spectrum, but amr doesn't have one or two.
you guys know what i mean.
walking on toes could be a symptom of autism.
headaches can be a symptom of a brain tumor.
feeling tired a lot could be a symptom of leukaemia.
symptoms are not always applicable, but are worth noting if they are a lot of the time, as in this instance clearly, so that never a diagnosis is made without them.
i walk on my toes, but it's because i'm bearing with strange toes that curl under and had to be surgically straightened two years ago.
my brother is autistic, but i didn't notice it either, but the spectrum is so broad, and i probably have a mild case of asperger's, so i have problems with communication and don't pick up on social reaction and body language.
then, i don't have the proper diagnosis, and you might even have some symptoms, which doesn't necessarily mean you have a certain condition.
i've been told for years that i don't walk on my toes, so i don't walk on my toes much.
i have dyspraxia.
so you could be dyspraxic or have short tendons.
i've drunk it to the dancers, gymnasts, ballet dancers, etc. as i find it more comfortable now.
i don't read too much about random symptoms like that either.
hello, i am a 12 year old girl (meaning i am 13 years old in 2 days) and i am addicted to self harm.
i started slitting my individual fingers with scissors at the age of 7 and never stopped from that day on.
it got worse because i had a scar on my leg from when i slit my leg open with a staple because i didn't stop cutting when i was bleeding because my ex boyfriend's name.
i have several slits in my arms.
then i healed them and cut myself with the staples and razor i stole from school.
when i could not find a cutter i took around 5 paracetamol and other drugs with lager and vodka.
i really am tempted to cut my arm off or burn myself to death while writing this.
i'm addicted, i cut again when one heals.
i think about it every day.
i am 12 years old and my life is already sick.
this is from a source where my dad left me at age 7 and didn't want to know me anymore.
he just cares about his little new girl, his wife and his new life that i don't want.
my best mate died at the age of 10.
i am in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and i am forbidden to speak to him because of events and the age difference.
my mum also suffers from bipolar and i have depression.
i don't want to stop.
i don't care what i do, i want to do it over and over again to torture myself. i hate myself.
but i love my best mate to death, he means the world to me, and if he does anything, i do the same.
i didn't tell him, but he found out.
i don't want to hurt him, i don't want him to hurt himself.
what do i do?
thank you for reading.
or are you on any drugs and getting any therapy?
talk to your school nurse or your general practitioner and tell them what is going on.
there are teachers you can trust, who you can tell.
if you tell them, they might be able to help you.
if you keep it bottled up inside, it's only going to get worse.
trust me, it's better to get this thing out of the way as early as possible, rather than let it get even worse.
please don't do this.
i am 17 and started self harm (mainly cutting my arms) last year, but i stopped a few months ago.
it's hard but you can do it.
i feel so much happier but seeing the scar reminds me of how i felt at that time and how strong those feelings were that i wanted to do such things to myself.
and it's also strong. you can do it. i found salvation through writing poetry and keeping a journal.
self harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
remember, self harm does not define you.
you can overcome it.
i thought i was getting a form of ocd cause i found myself always checking to make sure i didn't lose or leave anything behind whenever i went out especially to university.
i often have to check twice a go and then i cann't resist checking again after 30 seconds for some reason.
why is this?
or am i crazy or something?
and it is often when it carries many things, but rarely does it carry them, and even still it checks many times a day, is this any extent of ocd?
what can i do to make this happen?
if i don't check, i get very anxious, sort of away after 15-30 minutes, but often the anxiety is not that much that i cann't wait that long.
i feel doomed if i lose my wallet or phone.
i just wish i could go out without worrying about leaving something or losing something every two minutes.
i really don't know what to do, and i'm afraid to go to a general practitioner.
probably never heard of some compulsion like this, and just don't know what i'm doing.
do any of you have a similar ritual?
people think i'm crazy but it's very strange how difficult it is to get yourself out of this.
perhaps you could advise me on what?
i used to do this on my way to college, and had a list of items i knew i had on me, and used to compulsively check on the bus.
i have more severe anxiety now and i think this is a warning sign, so just try to wean yourself off the habit while it's relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor, but also tell them not to keep checking this thing.
don't worry about that, the doctor saw much worse cases.
i did an ocd class in psychology today.
the way to get rid of it is just to avoid compulsive acts, so don't check to see if you've lost something and just leave it.
your anxiety levels will increase over time, but gradually decreasing the level will hopefully make your ocd disappear over time.
that just sounds like you're overly anxious, not that you have ocd really bad.
i am very obsessive about getting up every 20 minutes at night to check that all the locks in my house are particularly locked.
sometimes i am convinced they are not locked, but i know they are.
i think it becomes a real problem when the obsessing really starts to interrupt your daily routine.
and you definitely aren't crazy, so don't worry about it, i'm sure your gp understands the issue.
i also went to therapy for other reasons, and they encouraged me to pick an obvious number to check in with and stick to it, and cut down.
i think teaching is an idea, and i'm still ok if i check 5 times or 20 times.
i'm a lot better so far, and i think anyone who wants to improve definitely has the hope of doing so.
i'm usually pretty calm about things, i like to take things as they come and i'm not too worried about things.
but i have to say that i have become really anxious about the thing over the last month or so and i'm not talking about mere nervousness from the blue.
i began to feel irrationally panicked by a variety of things that i hadn't worried about too much beforehand, that didn't even cross my mind as something that would ring alarm bells in my head.
i'm not sure if this is because of the lifestyle change (going from a care-free student to an unemployed graduate) or if it's a sign of other issues, but it's beginning to bug me because it's affecting my confidence and happiness.
i spoke to a few people, including my parents, about it, but all thought i was going through a random phase and should hold off acting until it was clear there was a serious problem.
so what is the best thing to do?
speak to your doctor about it and see if there is any edge taking off the anxiety pills.
can i speak to a counselor?
or should i take the advice of the people around me and just take the anxiety with a pinch of salt until it becomes a problem?
well, don't start trying to eye my anxiety, it makes me tense and more likely to panic, there's a death circle there.
i would recommend you try to focus on something that will guarantee you a smile or a feeling of happiness as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky about anything.
or if you cann't do that, get your friends to make you laugh when you start to feel panicky, because it works for me and i suffer random panic attacks and i'm laughing loudly.
just started to worry about the tiny things that really start to bother me, but not as severe as you from the sound of it.
i find just talking to someone else about what makes you anxious helps.
i find it a way of not moaning perhaps, i mention my worries to my mum and see her reaction to the situation in a calm way i should react, which makes me feel better about things, so i know it's not a big deal and i don't need to be anxious about it.
but if it worsens, go to the doctor.
i have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that can prevent him from leaving the house and doing things because he is so worried about what could go wrong.
the doctor gave her medication and it made her much better.

it doesn't take long.
route 288, a circumferential highway running around the southwest quadrant of the richmond-new urban region, opened in late 2004.
it already changes the development pattern, worsens it, and causes localized traffic congestion around its exits.
the richmond times-dispatch tells the tale of the impact of the huguenot trail in powhatan county today.
will jones reported that traffic on one section of huguenot trail has more than doubled since 288 opened.
speed and accidents are surging as well.
so far this year, there have been 17 accidents near the intersection of winterfield road, up from 12 all of 2004.
dale totten, a residential engineer with the virginia department of transportation, notes that vdot could add four lanes to the road at a cost of about $ 13 million if they had more money.
of course vdot doesn't have the money to construct roads in the richmond region.
because vdot is spending all their frigging money on 288 because of local politicians and boosters.
where is homer simpson when you need him?
this is a major moment, doh!
we predict that route 288 will generate residential development in the area around all of its exits, which is a scarce populated area, overtaxing the local country road.
others choose where they work and where they live, but limited access highways can relieve traffic for drivers between chesterfield county and goochland county going back and forth.
and they create traffic congestion in new places.
i was only surprised at how rapid this was.
i even think that there could be a 3-4 year lag.
think about it, the road has already created a construction cost of $ 13 million just at this exit, so think about the liability it creates for all of its exits.
another predictable thing.
after a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of a mega-commerce project at the intersection of 288 and a major road, the need for new road improvements soared.
well, we can see that the unfunded liability is zooming past the original $ 400 million taken to build the original highway well before the end of the decade.
the idea says that the brainiac who thought such a great idea was route 288.
i thank you for nothing.
i think we could spend $ 4 billion elsewhere better.
i think you shouldn't blame 288 for creating those people.
what if there are enough of them to create new traffic congestion in a new place?
there is additional traffic congestion in the old places?
now you understand what tmt in fairfax feels.
i usually take the road position.
288 is definitely excessive, but there are glaring needs in other parts of the state.
richmond has virtually no traffic.
the last 30 minutes of rush hour.
and you give them the beltway through a large rural area.
road to nowhere
just think, maybe this money can be spent on another potomac river crossing facility or desperately needed road improvements in nova.
the insult is that the state's help in paying for 288 in the budget deal last year added insult to injury, wiping out the debt, virginia centrists said.
very nice of you all to oblige us.
but it doesn't make much sense.
same old problem.
if you get ahead of the need, you're going to be accused of causing sprawl.
if you build in a place where there is already an acute need, you cann't claim to be paving your way out of congestion.
anonymous
fair enough.
5:26 makes a good point.
however, this situation hammers home the validity of the reports of the state auditors who found that ctb and vdot were funding transportation projects based on the best lobbying, instead of on a comprehensive state transportation plan.
i submit this is a situation that should not be tolerated and is a disgrace.
and senator chichester and his toadies are pouring more money into this flawed institution, making it worse.
what is the purpose of transportation expenditures?
in virginia it is for the benefit of private business plans and not for the public interest.
you're all dead wrong.
less than a week after the announcement, walter stoch stated that the money was intended for economic development on 288.
come on folk.
i don't understand your point tmt.
when was the last time you stuck in traffic and didn't end up in some sort of business?
i would say the whole purpose of the road seems to be to facilitate the public's interest in getting into and out of private business.
despite the sunday drive, grandmother's location trip and soccer game, business support is overwhelmingly needed.
it is not a wonder that we suffer from congestion problems because our expenditures on roads do not match the increase in business or state domestic products.
if we recognize that roads primarily benefit business, then we should do two things.
businesses will pay more for transportation bills, and we will incentivize businesses to locate where they will at least stress the system the least, even if that means more overall travel.
why is it so hard to understand?
by solving the functional settlement pattern and the balance between the transport system's capacity and the travel demand generated by land use.
spin everything else.
emr
tmt said it was for the benefit of private business plans and not for the public interest in virginia.
i don't see the point of this statement as it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else.
i think they are intertwined and tightly so, that they are virtually the same.
the local problem is obvious because this cookie dough is lumpy.
but in the end, if we demonize business long enough, we will eventually find that we are all working for the devil.
i don't see the point of claiming to have solved the dynamic balance that is ever changing.
even you see the positives of the rail to dulles because it is a job center that promotes the bidirectional demand.
i agree.
in fact, that may be all that is necessary, that is, that the reason for building it is that it was built.
all i'm saying is that the same logic should be applied to the roads.
they should have both ends in sight so that we can use our investments to the maximum.
we need more places to get closer to the balance you say we need.
here's a check of reality.
i drive past watkins landing every morning and evening.
i commute back and forth to my work location on huguenot trail.
i never see anything remotely like a traffic flood.
it's a 55 mph zone where cars are going between 75 and 100 in the morning.
the huguenot trail widening plan is already in the works because of the heavy development on the chesterfield side, a new school, and a whole bunch of development that existed in the zone years ago and was funneled through robious road.
288 is wonderful for those of us who actually use it instead of the bottleneck that would be powhatan and western chesterfield due to a lack of 288.
we can develop commercially and work closer to our lives.
you might think that is irrational use of land.
i don't desire to live in any city.
i refuse to work in the downtown area.
i refuse to use mass transit that is unsafe for female commuters who work long hours, not the regular 9-5.
and i like the fact that a lot of development is happening.
i don't understand exactly how i'm supposed to keep a horse on a quarter acre lot.
a gallon of gas could go for $ 10.
and i still pay to live in the country.
many people legitimately prefer horses, hunting, gardening, and certain types of small businesses that make them not want to live in the urban core.
this infatuation with city life truly baffles me.
every person has the right to live in the country if they wish to, anonymous 6:37.
but you are not right to have the rest of the state underwrite a 4 billion dollar highway construction to make shopping and getting to work easier.
in the debate over 288, there was a consistent overlooking of other things that could be spent on for $400 million.
much of the traffic congestion could be alleviated if the money was applied to other pressing road projects or even non-road projects (god forbid).
ray hyde, my comments are directed at investors who lobby for roads to be placed near their property and the incompetent systems that fund this request regardless of whether it is linked to a master transportation plan or not.
