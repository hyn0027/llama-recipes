support the person who started the thread resolutely, i will reply with a poem composed.
pledge to you to fight to the death to defend the diaoyu islands and related islands.
the fishing boats were bumped up in the fleet, the little evil japanese ghosts stirred up trouble and unrest, they again showed their wolfish appearance with the stolen heart and arrogant form.
don't go back to that time when we appeared to be humiliatingly signing a treaty, china is strong, the sword must be sharp, the knife must be shiny, let's bury the approaching enemy.
2010-09-11
i agree with the analysis of the person who started the thread. if a real war comes, i like to be named hua mulan to protect our home and defend our homeland, to spread the prestige of our china, and to pledge to fight to the death to defend our national dignity.
i wish i could bear that passionate upsurge long march of mao zedong to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all enemies of china and spread our dragon's prestige.
how long will we tolerate japan?
i say to my fellow citizens.
hello everyone, we all know about the september 18 th incident, but japan now has a premeditated plan to do another similar incident at sea, this time it is the lugou bridge incident again.
japan surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world and openly invaded our sacred territory, the diaoyu islands.
the diaoyu islands belong to china, we all know that, because of historical reasons, what belongs to us originally has become controversial.
fellow citizens, i say we are our own thing and why the need for negotiations? japan has gone even further, so they want to create the fact of occupation. can we allow this? absolutely not!
i say to my fellow citizens, japan's militarism brought grave disasters to the asian people.
china has suffered from japanese ravages for several decades long.
japanese unit 731 experimented on chinese, korean and other people with extremely brutal methods on human bodies in northeast, adding a layer of blood that will never fade away with the nanjing massacre incident; over a thousand kilometers of bones of the dead barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely barely
i have said to my fellow citizens too many instances of heinous crimes committed by japan in china that are difficult to record, not to exhaust all the bamboo strips.
just like those millions of deceased souls that lost their lives wandering over the pacific ocean and finding it difficult to rest in peace.
still, all those who experienced that era remember it vividly, and even our younger generation is crying tears down our cheeks and boiling with indignation as we turn the page of this historical page and read it.
actually, it is japan's now wanting to reverse the verdict on its aggressive history that has woken up fellow citizens and chinese in asia.
we have to go forward, despite the pain of looking back at this shameful 100 years, we have to create history and choose history, but the historical issues are not resolved.
responsible are the ones who do not make us fear, although the territory is small, it is related to the matter of dignity, the interests of the country and the nation's unity are guaranteed, regardless of how the wind and cloud changes, we cannot let our native land be separated, even if it is scarred with wounds.
fellow citizens, i would like to say that the 21 st century advent means that we are in a time when we are beset with difficulties inside and pressured from outside, and we are facing many challenges.
how should we go about dealing with taiwan, tibet, the south china sea, the surrounding environment and the aggressive foreign forces to china?
fellow citizens, i say, do. please look at the world map and see how the crescent-shaped encirclement is suppressing our breathing and strangling our development, and coveting our national territory.
we never feared the people, we just didn't want to make our enemies. we don't fear war, we just don't want war.
we must urgently arrange our arms and strengthen all our military forces on land, at sea and in the air.
china has flourished several times over the past thousands of years, but never has it had the ambition to expand its territory outward.
we do not impose on others what we do not want for ourselves, so we follow a strategic foreign security philosophy of benevolence and virtue.
the country's tolerance and liberalness is like the individual's, which means we have to insist that we not hurt others, but we have to avoid hurting ourselves.
tolerance is not certain fear, and sincerity is not obligatory cowardice.
china's exemption from japan's war repair caused by world war ii serves the benevolent peace.
i say to my fellow citizens, the people's heroes monument is a condensed history of china's nation that strives for continued improvement.
solemn and magnificent postures represent sacred expectations of peace.
my memory's string of thoughts is occasionally agitated by the many heroic and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses that spring up in my mind.
i went from that yellow page of history to that page of yellow history, like i saw kangxi, the emperor who contemplated how he achieved unification alone in his audience hall a hundred years ago, and also abraham lincoln, the former u.s. president who wandered alone in the dark great hall and thought of the integrity of the union.
snt1 while peaceful world is certainly dangerous to forget the war, i say to my fellow citizens, we must never exercise forbearance blindly, we want development and peace, snt2 the boxer protocol, which is a betrayal and humiliation of the nation, has aggravated china's poverty and backwardness in modern times, snt3 falling behind is the bully,
how will peace come if there is no strength?
we must focus on national defense education, build up the great wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people, and establish a full range national defense system capable of attacking and defending.
the best defense is attack; we should strengthen the force that can engage in an attack that is potentially possible and improve the deep and great combat capability in all aerospace; you must increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment, and establish a high-quality elite high-tech division premised on avoiding the influence of the economic development of the nation.
the battle horns are about to sound, people are already fully equipped and ready to go.
without the support of the people we accomplish nothing but with their support we are all powerful.
i say to my fellow citizens, it is time for us to come together for the sake of our nation, for the sake of our children, and for the sake of our future. it is time for us to come together to rebuild our economy, to rebuild our military, and to rebuild our country.
1. establish a guarantee fund; improve the working environment and working mechanism; recruit back to china hundreds of thousands of information technology professionals who have emigrated to the united states and around the world.
2. create a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
3. manufacture 5,000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds.
4. accelerate research and deployment of high speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles that could break missile defense systems.
5. resume nuclear experiments and establish a military force in space.
6 ) retain 1,000 nuclear bombs the equivalent of 10 million tons of trinitrotoluene, and install nuclear warheads on all short-range and medium-range missiles when needed.
(7) retain 30 nuclear-powered strategic submarines capable of inflicting 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
8. you have abandoned your commitment not to use nuclear weapons first.
9. retain the right to preemptive strike when national security is threatened.
fellow citizens, i am confident and i am improving, only if we strive to be strong, we can say that we can strive to be strong. qin shi huang unified china, zheng chenggong recovered taiwan, we must carry on the far-sightedness, insight and strong will of our predecessors.
fellow citizens, now that piece of land that trembles far from motherland and moans and calls is shaking and trembling, let's carry forward what the previous generations wished for but was not fulfilled, let's move forward courageously and carry forward what the previous generations wished for but was not fulfilled.
reading history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmered into my concern for the nation. i will serve our motherland as a volunteer, to make our motherland prosper and be splendid once again. even if i die, i have no regrets, i am willing to bear the cloth gown and be included in the common people. my sincere and patriotic heart is adequate to show to heaven.
i composed this poem here in the classical form of ci to voice the aspirations of my heart.
paint the lips a deep red.
protect the diaoyu islands.
we lost our ryukyu islands bitterly.
how can we allow diaoyu islands to fall into the hands of other countries?
100 years of vicissitude
the smoke and cloud chased the flying wave.
the youngest brother is still tender and youthful.
all directions wandered and the seals bore.
flagged for looking over.
we brandished our weapons and crossed east.
let the horses drink from the pacific ocean.

why aren't we fighting the little japan?
what is it that chinese people tolerate still?
they even ride on our heads.
do the chinese gut still do this?
we should tell the whole world that china cannot be bullied at will.
it's time we showed our strength, china has been too calm for too long.
our citizens' life is currently too carefree, officials are too extravagant.
we don't have cohesion now already, china needs to start a war, the face of the countries that follow the american rear is going to be slapped harshly.
let them know the us is not a panacea, if we win, china's influence can be increased, and the cohesion of the citizens can be improved, if we lose, we can clean out the incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out, let china have new blood and update, get china up.
go china!
i suggest that china strengthen the guard of diaoyu islands, and guard it every day, and protect the fishermen and our country's sovereignty. if japan dares to invade our territory by military force, we will fight a small scale war to defend ourselves, regardless of the cost. china can not lose.
we need to show in life, but really, you showing you're someone's embrace is p.
i just passed by.
this is like the whole society including stars.
damn, not sexy.
it cannot be accepted totally.
entertainers are just cheap, so i agree. their reputation in feudal china is somewhat sensible.
their lives were glorious.
the group consisted of nine professionals.
life is hard
shocked
that's normal, and whores are always heartless and the performers are never righteous.
they want the money, not the face.
look at the wolf near ms. fan with glasses, you know the actor has to drink with him or he will not be forced out or even framed.
son of a bitch
as long as there's something lovely to eat, it's ok.
no one is easy, the life is like a show, you have to look at the script to know how to perform.
all of us.
all his life, he walked 360 times, the top scorer in the imperial examination, but behind him, there was so much effort and endeavor, this humiliated the words of vermicelli beans.
haha:
overdoing
reality
shoot that hooligan.
cheap performers
cheap performers.
the entertainment circle is dirty, all the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
pity them, but who to blame?
everybody does this, how can you make money if you don't?
when a woman is in front of other people, she is proud, but when she is alone, she is melancholy.
nowadays, stars are just popular prostitutes of ancient times. they are famous now, so it's just normal for them to drink or even sleep with some high officials.
stop talking to other people, just behave.
what should we do in the future? not alone capability is enough to succeed, should we face such hard choices too?
the more suffering, the glorious the look, which is undisputable.
it's not so bad because they're just playing in their own circle, out of sight, out of mind.
but the old guy zhang jizhong, who behaved hooliganishly in his circle and also thought that he was virtuous because of his talent, made a tv series when he had nothing to do to wreck the people of the whole country.
both took what they needed.
when will china have a pure and innocent girl?
now the story is very shocking in the entertainment world, rumors are that hsu yuki was forced out because he refused to drink with guests arranged by the company, and was obliged to switch to working as a lawyer's assistant to make an end meeting instead.
superstars often encounter social engagements or circumstances they are not welcome to but have to join in.
they cann't decide on many things after all because the decision has to do with many aspects and the interests of many people.
sometimes it is not so simple that a dinner party for a star seems like we imagine it to be, that it cann't be that simple for a very normal dinner party that seems like we ordinary people imagine it to be.
the stars have lots of contracts and if they tackle well their sources of money will roll in, if not she will come to her heels, either by being forced out or even in a frame.
there are two smart and star female kind:
the second kind of people are good at playing tricks and achieving their objectives with their own seed money.
even some super star female will win their first role this way.
after drinking some alcohol, the advertiser or sponsor of the show may have a chance to lie on the star's shoulder, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, and the star adopts the most enduring attitude.
they are very from the 9 lower professions.
those stars are just pretending, and actually living a damn good life, much better than this.
just a cheap entertainment person, there is somewhat of a sense to their reputation in feudal china.
agrees.
oh well, not easy for the actors.
they deserve it, they asked for it.
nothing is easy for me, the dawn.
woman is a bird and a beast, and man is worse than both of them.

the international atomic energy agency (iaea) has reached an agreement with iranian officials stating that there are no remaining issues or ambiguities regarding iran's nuclear program and activities.
u.s. and european officials suspect that the iranian civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials suspect that the iranian civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials are possible to impose a 4 th round of sanctions on tehran as the u.n. security council is likely to consider the issue of iran's nuclear program in september 2007.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) distributed limited copies of a publication copying the iaea's reports before the iaea's 35-member board met on 070911.
the findings reflect the agreement reached between tehran and the iaea on 21 august 2007 which was publicized by iranian officials beginning the week of 12 august 2007.
the accord says that the issue of the program and its ambiguities regarding iran's nuclear program will remain.
a reuters news account said the iaea report said the step was a significant step forward in the work plan.
a senior u.n. official was quoted by reuters as saying that iran's efforts to enrich uranium were slow.
the iaea report stated that iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of iran's present and future nuclear programs.
an iranian official stated on august 30, 2007 that iranian officials were cooperating with the iaea to prevent further rounds of international sanctions.
iran's representative to the iaea ali asghar soltanieh stated to the fars news agency in tehran that the report emphasizes that there is no sign or evidence indicating diversion of iran's nuclear activities and that all of iran's nuclear material has been audited.
some non-proliferation experts stated that the iaea has ceded too much to iran.
in a criticism published 19 august 2007, david albright of the washington-based institute for science and international security and jacqueline shire of the institute for science and international security wrote that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that iranian officials provide the iaea with access to key people, facilities and documents needed to verify the iaea's answers to its questions.
independent experts stated that iran's agreement with the iaea to give inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information was the shortest it could be under western demands for iran to halt production of highly enriched uranium which could be used in a potential nuclear bomb.
u.s. state department spokesman tom casey stated that iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program but the report may offer some new details or insights into the country's development of the program.
casey stated that the nuclear program is continuing to move forward and shows that the iranian regime is continuing to defy the international community.
most western non-proliferation experts stated that the 20070821 agreement contained little that would dissuade policymakers in washington, london, paris and berlin from moving another round of security council sanctions forward.
experts stated that many of the transparency issues that were previously resolved in the 20070821 agreement should be resolved previously.
daryl g. kimball, director of the arms control association, a washington, d.c.-based think tank that is non-partisan, stated that the agreement addresses the problem of iran's pursuit of enrichment technology and capabilities that could lead to the production of nuclear material for a bomb.
kimball stated that the iranian government is designed to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim progress.
iranian officials stated that sanctions could be reduced if the inspectors are collaborated with by iranian officials.
the security council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on iran, but the penalties were limited because of pressure from china and russia.
soltanieh stated in an interview with iranian state-controlled television that the report and the measures made any other international organization irrelevant and unjustified in intervening.

the document outlining israel's proposal for the international organization to allow the transfer of nuclear technology to non-signatories of the non-proliferation rules was distributed to the nuclear suppliers group.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india from nuclear trade sanctions.
israeli officials have convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines that would allow international transfers of nuclear technology to states that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
prohibit countries not party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (india, israel, pakistan) from participating in international nuclear trade, including purchases of reactors, uranium fuel, or yellowcake.
the israeli proposal outline was distributed to the 45 nuclear suppliers group members in march 2007.
the israeli presentation was made in a paper that did not allow for official denials.
the letter from the nsg chairman said that israel's presentation was offered in the context of the nsg's debate over the indian bid for exemption on march 17, 2007.
only india and israel among non-treaty signatories qualify to be admitted to the nsg on the basis of the proposal of those countries.
israel's plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-treaty states in the nuclear field.
one criterion indicates that israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and says that israel should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if it applies stringent physical protection, control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons, facilities and material in its territory, all nuclear source materials and all special nuclear materials in its territory.
the document circulated in the capitol hill in september 2007 as the bush administration worked toward an agreement with the indian officials.
arms control association executive director daryl kimball stated that the israeli document could affect the debate in india.
kimball stated --
at the nsg, officials from india and the united states were not wanting to obstacles to the largest and most powerful country india and the united states.
reaching a consensus on india will be difficult at the nsg meeting in november 2007.
israeli proposals gave some officials reasons to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
israel's record following international nuclear rules is good and better than india's.
the bush administration has rejected israeli proposals despite israel's ties to the u.s. government.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india from nuclear trade sanctions.
president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice view the pact as an important part of the bush administration's foreign policy legacy.
the deal has been controversial in india and will require congressional approval.
the delay in winning approval for the india deal could negatively affect the administration's foreign policy legacy, with the most negative effect coming from the delay in the election year.
state department spokesman tom casey stated that the u.s. government views the india deal as unique and does not see it as a precedent for any other country, including israel.
israeli embassy spokesman david siegel stated that the suggestion that the israeli government demand exemptions or link the effort to any other issue, including the indian debate, is grossly inaccurate.
seigel stated --
the israeli government has never asked the nsg for an exemption from the nsgs guidelines on nuclear supplies, nor has it ever made a specific request for israel.
israel has fully fledged recognition of the nsg guidelines.
the israeli government urged the nsg to consider adopting a generic, tiered, criterion-based approach to the transfer of nuclear technology.
some nsg officials previously suggested an approach similar to israel's plan.
the non-nuclear proliferation regime will be considerably enhanced if the ngsl guidelines are modified in line with the proposals of israeli officials.

international; proliferation
ahmadinejad announced that iran's capability to produce uranium has been expanded.
iran refuses to commit to a halt in expansion but hints that a halt could happen in the future.
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashhad on july 26, 2008 that iran has expanded its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium over 5,000.
ahmadinejad stated that the expansion is the first since the april 2008 announcement that iran was approaching implementation of 6,000 centrifuges.
iran has articulated a goal of 50,000 centrifuges operating at an enrichment plant near natanz.
the international community demands that iran halt nuclear material production.
the media reports differ from the number of centrifuges cited by ahmadinejad.
iranian news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated that iran has 6,000 working centrifuges but subsequently removed the statement from the internet.
another iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100,000 centrifuges.
experts discount the significance of ahmadinejad's claims because there is no information on the functionality of the centrifuges.
western diplomats speaking anonymously in tehran said the number of centrifuges was less important than whether the machines operated and were efficient but that ahmadinejad's assertions were hindering resolution of the diplomatic standoff between iran and the west.
new america foundation arms control expert jeffrey g. lewis stated that the think tank is aware of iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but does not know the status of the machines' operational status.
diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems hinder iran's enrichment program.
iran repeated its assertion that its nuclear program is aimed only at producing electricity because producing nuclear weapons contradicts islamic principles.
the us, israel, europe and the majority of western arms control experts believe that iran is pursuing the capability to produce a bomb immediately if it decides to do so.
experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple.
ahmadinejad stated that the west is still pursuing the resumption of negotiations after iran resisted western demands to halt its nuclear activities.
eu foreign policy chief javier solana recently presented iran with the two offers.
a package consisting of incentives to cease production of enriched uranium which is endorsed by the us.
for six weeks during the freeze, iran will not add centrifuges and the west will refrain from promoting a fourth round of economic sanctions against iran at the un security council.
us officials have repeated that negotiations cannot begin before iran halts all enrichment-related activities that can be verified, but the bush administration has recently agreed to a proposed freeze and dispatched burns to geneva.
iran refused to respond to the offer made by solana on july 26, 2008 in geneva talks attended by us undersecretary of state william j. burns.
the talks constitute the highest level of diplomatic contact between the us and iran in nearly 30 years.
solana, burns and the european envoy set a deadline for iran's positive response before solana and burns initiated new sanctions including a prohibition on selling iran vital refined petroleum products.
iranian officials refused to commit to stopping the expansion or observing the deadline.
ahmadinejad appeared on july 26, 2008 to suggest that iran could potentially halt the expansion of centrifuges over a period of six weeks.
ahmadinejad stated that the west consented to the existing and operating centrifuges of between 5000 and 6000 if the number of centrifuges is not increased.
5000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear material to make a power plant or an atomic bomb if highly enriched.
6000 centrifuges running continuously could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for 1 bomb in 6 months.
in 20080500 the international atomic energy agency stated that iran possessed 3500 operational centrifuges.

the paris diplomatic meeting concluded that further steps to pressure iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility would not be agreed.
20081114 a diplomat stated to the media that at the meeting in paris on 13 november 2008 united states officials, european officials, russian officials and chinese officials had not reached agreement to take further action to persuade iran to halt uranium enrichment at its facility in natanz.
the highly technical process of uranium enrichment can produce fuel for nuclear power plants and produce fissile material for atomic weapons.
the 081113 meeting ended without any new measures announced.
the french foreign ministry released a statement on 13 november 2008 stating that after the 13 november 2008 meeting the state of affairs declared that the international community reaffirmed the importance of a dual-track approach to engaging iran diplomatically and working towards sanctions.
russia and china resisted new sanctions against iran.
russia and china are closely tied to iran politically and economically and do not feel domestic pressure to act against iran.
the united states is not close tied politically and economically to iran and feels domestic pressure to act against iran.
russia and china hold veto power over security council decisions.
russian diplomat sergei ryabkov was quoted by interfax news agency in moscow as saying that at a meeting on november 13, 2008 russia will not strike a deal on iranian sanctions and that western countries favor the sanctions but china and other countries do not support them.
ryabkov attended the meeting on november 13, 2008.
a significant progress report was released this week regarding iran's progress on the heavy water reactor research facility near arak.
the heavy water iranian research reactor near arak may eventually be able to produce plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons.
satellite images published by the institute for science and international security showed significant progress in the construction of the heavy water research reactor near arak from february 2008 to october 2008.
david albright stated that the heavy water reactor near arak in iran for research purposes has evaded notice from the international security community.
david albright stated that satellite images said that progress at the iranian heavy water research reactor near arak was significant and that the reactor had made significant progress in the building frame and was on its way to becoming a large finished facility in the last 1.5 years.
david albright was a former arms inspector and is the director of the washington, d.c.-based institute for science and international security.
iran stated that it is pursuing nuclear technology for energy production and research.
the united states and its western allies suspect that iran will precede its nuclear production efforts with the creation of nuclear weapons infrastructure.
low grade uranium production is legal under international arms control regulations.
the technical and diplomatic challenge facing the incoming barack obama's united states foreign policy team is to take on the task of stopping iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons, which iran has developed to the latest stage.
in the last month in power, the george w. bush administration has managed to synchronize u.s. policy with the european union leaders, the british leader, the french leader and the german leader in pressing for tougher sanctions against iran and diplomatic action.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) is expected to release a report next week criticizing iran.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) is a nuclear watchdog and a united nations organization.
the emergence of a new initiative on iran's nuclear program has decreased hopes that another set of united nations security council sanctions will be imposed before the end of president bush's term.
iran continues to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology while maneuvering diplomatically.
some israeli officials said they were alarmed by iran's recent test-firing of a two-stage solid-fuel rocket with a range of 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers).
tel aviv is less than 650 miles from iranian territory.

the russian high - security laboratory complex that stores anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria faced a loss of electricity because it lacked payment to the electricity utility mosenergo.
a large repository of deadly pathogens, including anthrax, plague and other killers, is threatened with loss of electricity at a high-security russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of moscow.
a russian electricity utility official from moscow region's mosenergo arrived recently at a russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off electricity because of lack of payment.
the russian laboratory complex is a campus of 90 buildings and served as the location of the soviet union's secret biological weapons program.
incorrect headlines in izvestia newspaper stated that the virus that killed in the moscow region depository threatened the city.
the virus is at the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
every kind of bacterium studied for use in soviet union's secret biological weapons program were at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the virus repository is located in siberia.
russian and western officials stated that the power cut off at the state scientific center of applied microbiology was unlikely to result in any threat to public health.
russian and western officials stated that there was not enough certainty to know why power was lost at the state scientific center of applied microbiology and that this could pose a threat to public health.
nikolai urakov, a general, said by telephone that the state scientific center of applied microbiology has a system that could be quite reliable and emergency protective.
nikolai urakov, a retired general, has been the director of the state scientific center of applied microbiology for a long time.
the state scientific and applied microbiology center is working with western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedicine manufacturing site.
nikolai urakov, a general, said by telephone that the researchers at the state scientific center of applied microbiology were scared by this threat of sudden electricity shutdown, because of the kind of psychological pressure it puts on them.
nikolai urakov, a general, stated by telephone that scientists would have to destroy all ongoing bacteriology experiments if power was shut down at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
general nikolai urakov said that the united states and western countries have contributed about 6 million dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex and that another 500,000 dollars will be paid annually to pay electric bills and arrears of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
american scientists working at the state scientific center of applied microbiology stated that the russian government is responsible for paying the research institute's electric bills.
1997 peak of western aid to convert one of gen. nikolai urakov's bioweapons laboratories because iran offered to purchase research institute experts.
the crisis is being orchestrated by russian scientists and military leaders who depend on western finance to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the sense of crisis is being increased to increase western finance.
american scientist randall lee beatty worked to convert the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity at the state scientific and applied microbiology center is a crisis.
randall lee beatty is the director of the international science and technology center.
the international science and technology center financed approximately half of the general nikolai n. urakov's budget to support about 350 russian biowarfare scientists and technicians.
randall lee beatty stated that the ssca m has known for 14 months that the ssca m has not paid its electric bill.
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific and applied microbiology center is one of the most important locations in the world for archiving dangerous pathogens and that it is a shame that the location was destroyed because of non-payment of electricity bills.
approximately 3000 strains of the bacterium are stored at the state scientific center of applied microbiology and many others are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment in all-layered enclosures and oversized air handling systems that depend on electricity for function.
defrosting frozen live germs is the greatest danger from the shutdown of the electric power at the state scientific and applied microbiology center.
raymond zilinskas, a biological warfare expert at the monterey institute of international studies, stated that the main threat is that the power of the state scientific center of applied microbiology has been cut instead of the threat of the possibility of the organisms escaping.
raymond zilinskas stated that if the worst case scenario occurs, the bacterium would be defrosted at minus 70 degrees and the clean up afterwards would be a real mess because it is not certain that all the bacterium would die.
another example is mosenergo electricity utility confronting the obolensk state scientific center of applied microbiology, which shows that the basic capitalist imperative of enterprise self-sustainability can be dangerously clashed with the old things that remain from soviet union weapons science.
the russian national power company cut off electricity at a strategic base where nuclear missiles are on high alert because the 2000 power bill was overdue.
the silos for nuclear missiles will not lose power.
arm troops marched to the substation and turned the power back on.
united energy systems, a national company, cut power in january and february 2001 at a number of military installations around russia.
the kamchatka center that monitors the russian space forces includes a lost military installation.
electricity was quickly restored in most cases of military installations that had their electricity cut off.
the investigation showed that the war tug of the utility and military often forces the military to spend electricity power budget funds instead of diverting money to other useful things.
some budget cuts have been made to fund the construction of residences in the country for the generals.

brazil has implemented a law allowing the air force to target drug aircraft in brazil's airspace.
the us is concerned about liability if a civilian plane is misidentified.
brazil announced that the air force would begin shooting down aircraft used to traffic in illegal drugs in brazil's airspace.
the plan requires eight precautionary steps before issuing an order to shoot down a plane.
prior to the policy taking effect in late october 2004, the publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they needed to file a flight plan.
the law permitting such actions was originally approved in 1998 but president fernando henrique cardoso never put the policy into effect.
the united states dissuaded cardoso from signing the decree because the united states was concerned that the accidental downing of a civilian aircraft could expose the government and companies to lawsuits.
in april 2001 the united states reduced its support for operations targeting drug-running aircraft after a peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed a peruvian missionary and her child.
the relatives of the victims sued the us government and won a settlement from them because they provided intelligence and technical support for the operation.
a state department official stated that --
under certain conditions, us law could forbid assistance to countries implementing the shoot-down law.
the us agrees with brazil's assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
the us government consulted the brazilian government on the provisions of the brazilian law.
brazilian defense minister jose viegas stated that brazil is encountering difficulties in securing us support for the plan but that recent bilateral talks have led to a certainty that the brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing brazil to commercial sanctions.
brazilian officials expressed hope that the us would endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
the us has scheduled 10.2 million dollars in drug aid and law enforcement aid for brazil for 2004.
former air force chief mauro jose miranda gandra, current director of the air institute of the estacio de sa university in rio de janeiro and a general, stated that the government took a courageous step but the impact could be more political than practical because of the restrictions imposed by the brazilian government.
brazilian officials stated that the policy could not be applied against aircraft with children on board.
viegas stated that there is a need for limits.
gandra stated that the provision undermines the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug smuggling aircraft carrying children because it introduces the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
viegas stated in an interview in brasilia that the government would use the law more powerfully to dissuade drug traffickers who previously felt they were not threatened by the air force.
the deterioration of the public security situation in sao paolo and particularly in rio de janeiro where powerful and increasingly violent drug gangs are active prompted the government to act.
in rio de janeiro, drug gangs have more firepower than the police, have successfully attacked police stations, and have forced businesses and schools to close.
president luiz inacio lula da silva stated in an interview with a foreign correspondent in 2003 --
policies are about national sovereignty and national security.
some drug-running aircraft pilots feel so confident of immunity from retribution that they gesture obscenely at the brazilian air force pilots in pursuit.
under brazil's prohibition of the death penalty for criminal acts, is the constitution a law?
some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounts to a de facto death sentence for drug traffickers, contrary to the government's claims.
the o estado de sao paolo newspaper in an editorial for the week of 18 july 2004 to 24 july 2004 stated that the extreme measure raises problems of ethics and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefit.
the person is applying extrajudicially the administrative decision of the air force commander.
these people gained the power of life and death over the crew members and regular flyers.
brazil inaugurated the sivam radar system in 2002 at a cost of $ 1.4 billion which allows the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive amazon region for the first time.
the system uses united states technology.
illegal flights initially declined by 30 % due to concerns about improved tracking capabilities of traffickers but subsequently reaccelerated.
brazil recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003.
some of these flights violate the innocent ranchers who fly between plantations in the amazon.
viegas stated that the deliberate violation of brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who appear to realize the government is incapable of retaliation has increased significantly.
in april 2001 fernandinho beira-mar, the most notorious drug boss in rio de janeiro, was captured in colombia on a drug-gun pipeline involving left-wing guerrillas.
the northern amazon corridor of brazil has become a busy and increasingly essential route in the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
according to reports the route of the most important supply route for cocaine into europe via drug and gun smuggling runs from colombia to suriname across the northern tier of the amazon.
colombia is the only country currently having a policy of targeting drug trafficking aircraft.
colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the united states.

international; weapons; leader; military
the venezuelan president is worrying venezuela and its domestic critics by dealing with russia on weapons, curbing military cooperation with the united states and planning to train as many as 2 million civilians to repel a possible invasion by a superpower.
chavez, the venezuelan president, is worrying the united states and domestic critics with plans that include weapons deals with russia, curbs on military cooperation with russia and plans to train up to 2 million civilians to repel a possible imperialist invasion.
chavez insisted the move was purely defensive and was overdue for venezuela to update its obsolete military hardware and protect itself from any nation that might want to control venezuela.
venezuela is the country that produces the most petroleum compared to south america.
domestic chavez opponents scoffed at the idea of the us ever invading venezuela and charged that chavez truly intended to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists to protect against any internal rise up and to pose a militarized counterweight to the us' influence in latin america.
castro is a major ally of chavez and the two have grown closer.
detractors of chavez in the us government say that the strategy of restructuring venezuelan democracy through the image of a militarized style of socialism could even more troubled by having chavez purchase arms and indoctrinate civilian militias.
us strategists are increasingly concerned about the potential fomenting of such a revolution by chavez's radical moves, inspired by chavez.
latin american politics has shifted leftward since the late 1990 s.
this leftward shift is largely a reaction to the perceived failure of free market economics.
the left elected to lead brazil, argentina, chile, uruguay, ecuador and venezuela.
chavez's home supporters countered that the united states has a long history of open and covert armed intervention in the domestic politics of latin america and said that the united states has no right to question venezuela's preparedness for defense.
carlos roque espinoza leon said venezuelans never asked what the us marines did.
venezuela's national assembly, the country's serving government, has espinoza leon as its specialized defense.
espinoza said peru has 500,000 rifles and no one says anything.
espinoza said no one complains about colombia being the most militarized country in latin america.
espinoza said the us history is full of aggression in latin america.
espinoza said venezuelans must do whatever is necessary to protect the country.
chavez said in his fame that the so-called venezuelan bolivarian revolution was a peaceful event but armed.
chavez was first elected in 1998 and according to an independent poll by datanalisis, he has a 71 % popularity rating.
venezuelan military analyst alberto garrido said chavez was looking for allies in russia, china and iran to promote a multi-polar world that would counteract us domination and encourage grass-roots movements in latin america to throw off government influence.
farmer lorenzo campos in the venezuelan state of anzoategui and reservists were trained by him.
campos said venezuelans want the world to know that they are not preparing an attack on anyone and that the mission is to protect the country.
in may 2005 chavez's government announced details of a deal with the russian firm to purchase 100,000 ak-103 assault rifles each with 30 rounds of ammunition for 18.6 million dollars and the transfer of technology to venezuela to manufacture the rifles.
the deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle.
the price of these things is considerably less than the $ 825 - $ 850 price of the same weapon ordered through the us mail.
the venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 russian helicopters, 10 spanish transport planes and 6 naval craft from russia.
venezuelan officials said the government had negotiated with brazil to buy around 24 air support and train planes.
chavez insisted and even the staunchest military critic here, retirees, agreed that the purchase was essential to update old weapons like the fal, decades old from belgium's military.
retired general fernando ochoa antich said the statement that chavez is engaged in an arms build-up is an exaggeration.
ochoa was defense minister in 1992 when chavez launched a failed coup.
ochoa stated that venezuela has not purchased arms in the past 25 years and that chavez has not bought weapons aggressively or in a threatening manner towards venezuela's neighbors.
ochoa said venezuela never bought arms from russia before and suggested chavez bought the arms to become independent of the us.
ochoa asked why chavez bought the popular rifle caliber among subversive forces in latin america and stated that his political support for radical leftist moves made him a menace to the continent.
the pentagon has openly questioned what chavez is doing with the old fal rifles and whether he might be sharing weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in latin america.
the us government has provided no evidence that chavez is arming or funding a leftist insurgency.
military analysts who analyzed the colombian farc guerrillas said the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and are not interested in old rifles from belgium or chavez's assistance.
a 2003 us defense intelligence agency (dia) study reported that more than half of the weapons seized from colombian guerrillas between 1998 and 2001 originated in venezuela.
implying that corrupt venezuelan military members or those sympathetic to the guerrillas could aid the guerrillas.
critics say the chavez-opposing domestic may be more distressed by the chavez-ideology military and civilian reservists new people are mindful of.
so chavez called for the revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist the superpower aggressor earlier in 2005 and said the resistance would be the first step in training the active duty armed forces backed by volunteers of 1 million to 2 million in the coming year.
military analysts estimate venezuela's active duty armed forces number at 83,000.
the president's own defense unit was created in neighborhoods, state companies and the chavez-established free university and reports directly to the president.
the government insists that the reserve supports the armed forces and will not act against the fifth column against chavez's possible coup.
espinoza said that reserves should not be used for troops shocked by any political party and that each person would decide which side to take in a civil war.
general julio ramon quintero viloria is the commander of the reserve.
quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians over half of 2005 and over 20 weekends and that 300,000 more civilians could be trained in 2006.
quintero said venezuelans don't want any empire's colony and are ready for any possibility.
in june 2005 100000 reservists and the venezuelan navy engaged in a massive war game to repel a stronger invader country.
in june 2005, 40 state oil company employees participated in a similar exercise with 1,200 soldiers.
the chavez-favoring circle here warns of asymmetrical warfare.
asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by us strategic military personnel to describe conflicts between unequal combatants in which the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
the us government has given colombia 3.3 billion dollars in military aid over the past five years.
chavez loyalists fear that the us government may instigate a proxy war between colombia and venezuela in order to oust chavez and control venezuelan oil.
in an interview, a senior us official dismissed the notion that the united states government wants to invade venezuela as utterly completely nonsensical.
officials said the chavez side wishes to make a negative relationship because they calculate politically that mr. chavez will reach power by constantly confronting the us.
another rollback of chavez's military cooperation and joint exercises troubles the united states.
the us military has had a cooperation office in venezuela for 50 years.
in 2004 chavez shut it down.
5 us military trainers and students participating in the exchange program were ordered to leave the country in april 2005.
analysts say chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
analysts say chavez's use of that force to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere is unproven.

the north korean government could be preparing to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in june 2007 in a first step towards disabling it by december 2007.
christopher hill, the assistant secretary of state, stated on june 18, 2007 that the north korean government could be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor by june 2007 in a first step toward disabling it by december 2007.
hill is the head negotiator for the united states in the north korean nuclear weapons program.
hill stated that stalled efforts to dismantle north korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the international atomic energy agency inspectors visit pyongyang on june 16-17, which the pyongyang officials invited the inspectors to talk about verifying and monitoring the shutdown.
hill stated that the shutdown is anticipated to be long following talks with chinese negotiator wu dawei.
hill stated that it is possible to shut down in a week but not in a month.
the associated press reported that the iaea stated in vienna, austria that a team visited pyongyang in the week of june 24, 2007 to discuss the manner of inspectors verifying the shutdown.
hill stated that iaea inspectors held talks with pyongyang officials regarding the reactor seals, including the installation of television monitoring sites.
north korean officials refused to proceed with the agreement to begin decommissioning yongbyon until 25 million dollars in funds held in accounts linked to north korea in macao banks were transferred to north korea.
the money was frozen when united states officials accused banco delta asia of complicity in north korean financial crimes.
the amr graph states that the fund was wired to the new york federal reserve bank on june 14, 2007, after months of disagreement over the method of returning the fund.
the fund is supposed to have been sent to the russian central bank before the transfer to the north korean government's account at a russian commercial bank.
hill stated that talks with russian, south korean and japanese disarmament negotiators were to take place in the week of june 17, 2007 to recoup time lost in the transfer of financial disarmament.
the timetable for the resumption of six-nation talks on arms control is also part of the discussions.
under the agreement reached in february 2007 north korean officials pledged to shut down yongbyon and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for 50,000 tons of fuel oil shipments.
in the next phase of the agreement north korean officials declared an all-nuclear program and disabled all facilities and in return received a further 950000 tons of fuel oil.
hill stated that the technical conclusion for the next phase of the agreement could be reached by december 2007.

the nuclear suppliers group list shows that iran has been denied the purchase of nuclear-related materials approximately 75 times since 1998 because of suspicions that the purchases could be used to build a bomb.
the nuclear suppliers group (nsg) is an offshoot of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (npt) and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes does not go to military use.
the nuclear suppliers group is composed of advanced technology countries.
the nuclear suppliers group's mission statement says that countries will act on an individual basis to block trade that violates export controls devised to maintain international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
the nuclear suppliers group has no enforcement powers beyond notifying companies of violations of its guidelines.
the nuclear suppliers group keeps data private and meets in large secrecy.
most of the denials have been since 2002 and have resulted in intervention by a member country of the nuclear suppliers group.
diplomats from countries with an interest in exposing the extent of iran's efforts to acquire so-called dual-use items that could be converted into weapons were made available a list of trade denials.
the list is available, provided the identity of the diplomat and his country is not identified.
the list includes australian, finnish, swedish, united arab emirates and iranian companies prevented from carrying out deals because they are suspected of selling military items.

the official website of iraq's leading shiite religious leader, grand ayatollah ali al-sistani, was defaced and blocked in a cyber attack motivated by sectarianism.
the attack did not begin on 080918 or 080919 morning.
al-sistani's website was offline on 19 september 2008 evening.
another website related to one of al-sistani's religious organizations, www.al-shia.com, was also affected.
the alternative address www.sistani.com is still operational.
iran's fars news agency stated that xp group has blocked access to approximately 300 shiite-related sites on 080918 and 080919.
the claims of the hack and iran's assertions that the xp group is based in the united arab emirates cannot be verified independently.
several iranian news sites stated on september 19, 2008 that many of the websites related to shiite muslims and iran that were attacked had again run normally.
a statement signed by the xp group was posted on al-sistani's home page of his web site and stated that the attack was on behalf of the sunni muslims.

the somali pirates who hijacked the ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms approached a deal to release the ship.
questions emerge regarding the arms shipment to kenya and the possible clandestine arms dealings between kenya and south sudan.
20081008 maritime officials and associates of the somali pirates who hijacked the ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms on 080925 stated that the pirates could collect their ransom soon.
the party is close to reaching a deal that would pay pirates millions of dollars in ransom and free the ship after difficult negotiations involving several people involved in the haggling in a bazaar style.
ahmed omar ahmed of xarardheere in somalia stated that pirates had agreed to a ransom of approximately 8 million u.s. dollars from the ship's owners and that the ship could be freed on october 8 or 9, 2008.
xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the coast of somalia.
a kenyan maritime official stated that there is yet to be an agreement on critical details.
one such detail involves pirate's request for a guarantee that the pirates will not be arrested or attacked by the united states' warships currently encircling pirates.
a kenyan maritime official was quoted as saying such negotiations are complex and involve more than financial aspects.
officials stated on october 8, 2008 that progress was made and the parties approached an agreement.
the pirates initially requested 35 million u.s. dollars and then reduced it to 20 million u.s. dollars.
the pirates have consistently expressed a willingness to negotiate on financial figures.
more than 25 ships were hijacked off the coast of somalia in 2008 and typically ransomed for between $ 1 - $ 200,000 u.s.
ukrainian ship and cargo and the 20 sailors on board will be released in exchange for receiving payment of $ 100 united states dollars and the pirates prefer a $ 100 bill.
the original destination country of the arms shipment that boards a ukrainian ship is -
the government of kenya claimed that the weapons were being shipped to the kenyan military shortly after the freighter was hijacked on september 25, 2008.
ships via mombasa, kenya's main port
the weapons on board include 33 t-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
subsequently, evidence emerged of the weapons in the kenyan-southern sudanese arms clandestine deal.
the deal is likely to remain secret if the pirates do not hijack the ship and do not begin speaking to the media via satellite phone.
ukrainian officials are adamant in their denial of any wrongdoing.
ukrainian diplomat oleh belokolos in kenya stated --
ukraine has not supplied any arms to the government of south sudan and has no plans to do so.
all appropriate paperwork has been validated.
ukraine will abide by all united nations rules and agreements on arms control.
ukraine inherited an enormous stockpile of weaponry after the collapse of the soviet union and is now a major arms dealer.
the deal with ukraine is suspicious because kenya relies most on the united kingdom and other western countries for heavy weapons supplies.
kenyan politicians have demanded answers and called for several commissions to examine the situation.
southern sudan, which has increased its military capabilities in recent times and uses soviet-designed tanks, is a region of autonomy.
the united states military stated that it is prioritizing to ensure that the ship does not unload weapons and that the weapons are not sold to islamist insurgents in somalia.
pirates denied any interest in the weapons and claimed they were unaware tanks were included in the cargo when they hijacked the ship.
pirate spokesman sugule ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates' sole interest in the deal was money.

u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said that afghanistan produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in order to support the price and preserve a major source of insurgency financing.
u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said afghanistan produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support the price and preserve a major source of insurgency financing.
costa said this to reporters last week as the u.n. drug office prepared to release its latest survey of afghanistan's opium crops.
the survey showed that poppy cultivation has retreated much in afghanistan and is overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of the 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, mostly in the southern provinces.
the survey was issued on november 27, 2008.
the united nations found that the amount of land devoted to opium production in afghanistan was reduced by 19 percent, although the total production of opium dropped just 6 percent.
the study stated that high output acreage is attributed to the good growing season in the southern states.
the heavy irrigation of the south region where the taliban maintains a strong presence in 5 provinces and has systematically encouraged opium cultivation for several years to finance the taliban's insurgency.
the u.n. estimates that insurgents made much more than $ 300 million from opium trading last year.
costa said the effort could be funded by between 200 million and 3 billion dollars.
the taliban produced an amount of opium far in excess of world demand, for three successive bumper crop years.
costa said the result is a glut that depresses prices that have dropped by approximately 20 percent.
costa said the evidence that the price has not collapsed already indicates that the taliban, drug lords and even some farmers are stockpiling opium.
the increased amount is also in process in afghanistan.
costa added that insurgents hold a significant amount of opium.
costa said the surplus was as much as 11000 tons (18.5 million pounds) and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
the united nations found that afghanistan produced 8,500 tons of opium in 2008.
the world's demand is estimated at about 4400 tons per year.
the taliban stood passively by this year while the cultivation was cultivated and less pressure was placed on afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
then this supports the current price.
costa is an italian diplomat who has served as the u.n. office on drugs and crime for six years.

i'm 24 and my mother is 2.5
i have been broken up with my son's father since august.
i want to start dating other people and my father's son says that he has nothing to do with me if i do.
he is very possessive and controlling but he doesn't have the right to be because we are together.
right now his life is going on too much and he thinks we can work but i've told him several times i don't love him and he doesn't love me.
i want him to be there for his son, but he doesn't need me, either.
but he has no one, his family don't get along with him and they have issues.
i don't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he's around the more miserable i am.
i don't want him to be there for his son because he's a good father or at least trying to be.
i believe every child needs both parents, whether they are together or not.
but he thinks no one can have me if he cann't.
what do i do, moving on with my life?
it's very bad that your ex-significant other is threatening you using your son.
you cann't give in to that or it just escalates.
you have the right to live your life and be happy, so you don't cave in to his threats.
he would see his son regardless, if he really loved him, but this is just the typical method of control that he uses.
other people said, " it's like i'm killing myself if you leave me "? does it get through to you?
when is your date?
meet all kinds of people.
do what you want.
you'd be better off not having him if the price is that he walks out of your life voluntarily, both of your lives.
i agree, one other thing, he's not in business if you date him or not date him.
i didn't tell him.
he didn't threaten you, he didn't have a concern for your personal life.
can you document his threats?
you really need this.
quit taking his calls and make him leave voice mail.
make him email or text you.
keep that record.
get a lawyer and divorce.
if you cann't afford one, try for legal aid.
tell your ex-significant other that all communications need to go through a lawyer.
the bus driver, the people till there, and your food delivery people want the exact change.
do they not realize that you don't get a pile of change from the bank?
someone has to take notes somewhere, don't they?
people get lazy.
i'd like to be as near as possible, because i don't like counting copper all day.
if you take a twenty pound note on the bus, they'll just tell you to get on the bus because they're hell-lazy.
it is not illegal to pay a certain amount in coins, for example you can only pay 30 pence in pennies.
hello, i started uni in september but obviously i didn't gel with it immediately like most people.
but i know that my adjustment will take some time because i am very introverted, shy, especially anxious and all the rest.
on the night i first arrived here, i went out with all my housemates and it was the hardest thing i've ever had to do.
i went to a bar by myself when i was sober.
here's the point though:
i didn't enjoy university after being here for about 5 months, my course disillusioned me, i didn't enjoy the set project and i didn't like the delivery of the course much.
the university made out much better than it seemed.
i started off badly, finance for students is delayed and added to my stress levels, and i'm so worried that i'm unable to progress with my work, so it's all piled up and concluded.
i was assigned a counselor at the university, saw him in a block session for about 5-6 weeks, and in my honest opinion, it didn't really work out because i never really opened up to him.
only half hearted.
i'm loaded to the neck with work, have to hit major deadlines, depressed and anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time.
i no longer have a counselor because you can only have a person for so many sessions at a time and i doubt it would help me much if it hasn't already.
i lack motivation, i don't feel comfortable with my lecturers, i feel like i want to give in but i cann't because i'm going to end up in a dead end job and i aspire to be someone.
i'd rather die than be uneducated and not live the life i want to live, and by dropping out of university i'm making matters worse.
i'm 21, turning 22 this year, i don't have much time to fail, i have to do something.
i failed college once and did another course so i could get into university.
could someone please advise me of what is possible?
maybe you can go and see your doctor and see if there is any way you can get an extension of your deadline to try and ease the pressure a bit.
snt1 send an email like this to your tutor, they will consider mitigating circumstances, don't worry, they have seen all before, i know, i used to work in the university administration.
break your work into manageable chunks.
concentrate on one bit of work at a time, the most urgent assignment obviously.
don't shut off your housemate and do well because you are trying something new from the very beginning. keep it now.
i would recommend that you go see your doctor too.
you can benefit from speaking to someone if you are always anxious, my friend got therapy from the nhs because of anxiety, it's really normal.
try to get an extension, if you're honest i'm sure your university will allow it.
it's hard to keep strong and keep on living.
my mum divorced, she had horrible times with my stepfather and now she's found a new freedom and she's sending her round the bend.
she has epilepsy and manic depression with huge anger problems.
she is constantly horrible to me.
i cann't cope with her outbursts and the nasty, hateful things she says at home.
i'm 18 years old and at the point of my break and i have a 95 % bursary studying full time at a private school with high pressure in 6 th form.
i cann't work from home because she shouts at me.
then i got angry at my teachers.
she was lovely in one minute, like i had my mummy back, and then she turned into the most spiteful living human next minute.
i didn't pass my a2 exams and i've already accepted that i'm defeated and this year of my life is going to make me fail.
i don't know if i can come back to this, but the university has offered me the most amazing offer, but i cann't even accept it. i've never made a grade in my life.
i wish i could wipe her out from my life, things would be so much better without her.
but then i think to myself, " i'm just selfish ".
but surely that doesn't mean my life is like this, does it?
it's so much better.
but i feel like i'm powerless to control this downhill spiral.
and i don't know what to do.
thanks for reading.
nice vent.
you cann't get her section for that.
even does she have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis?
you sure don't know you didn't get a good grade, so you accept a place if possible.
life throws things at you all the time.
if you have no family members, then it's outsiders.
i've dealt with verbal abuse from my dad for 8 years now and honestly i'm here only because it's the only way out and that's the only reason.
if you really want out, work hard.
really, if she cann't give you consistent support, you need it from somewhere else.
can you call childline or something like it?
you can go to the library on saturday and study for 8 good hours.
can you go to your friend's house to form a study group?
so you want to section her because the section is a bit painful and you blame her for all your problems?
i know how you feel.
my mum spits from hell too.
i would highly recommend taking up smoking.
oh tsr grew up and stopped nagging, it's a joke.
i think i became a much weaker person in the last 2 years and way down dulling my personality in between to try and befriend some people at uni.
but when people are nicer than that, they lead you to believe that they can say whatever the hell they want to me or do whatever they want to me.
they show absolutely no respect.
for example, i say hello to someone from the university and they ignore me, but later on in the 30 minutes they decide they want my help with some work and i give it.
it's caused a lot of anger and distress in my life and it's really started to affect my concentration at uni.
has anyone got any experience of handling these sorts of things or how gains some respect again?
just say no.
if it doesn't particularly comfortable you, do it gradually.
you could start with " i'm sorry, but i'm busy "
of course you don't go over the top with it, you don't go in the completely opposite direction.
if you think about it no, then say no.
when they start to realize that you are not going to bend over backwards for them, they start to respect you more.
this is really such a bad attitude well you can be respected of course but that's not nice, that's foolish.
i don't know if anyone is reading this, but i just feel despair and i need to tell someone.
i left home in september and started university, i am incredibly anxious about doing this but i have delayed thinking about it until i get here, i am here now and have been here for over two weeks, i feel overwhelmed by it all and feel i am not intelligent and awkward socially.
i have been emotionally struggling since i moved to secondary school, i lost my dad around the age of 9 and always blamed it on how i felt, i had two periods of counselling in my life, one in 2009 december and this year around march.
i feel like i'm having a moment where i feel like my problems in life are overwhelmingly credible and i'm making myself doubt my self esteem which has always been low and i cann't concentrate on work and i often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions and i doubt myself about anything and everything.
my two counselors did not diagnose me with depression and suggested i was not suffering from depression, but i was huge worried about depression because my dad died of depression and suicide.
i tried to solve my problems before, found particular usefulness in exercises and meditation, also tried things like self-help books and tapes, but generally speaking i feel this is not my life, not my one and only chance to exist, not my one and only chance to be a young man. i wasted one and only chance to exist, one and only chance to be a young man. i'm beating this feeling away from me.
i simply don't know what to do, and i never follow through on what i think i should do, my friends often say i'm lazy, and i cann't disagree a lot of the time, i feel like people are trying to do everything they can to help me, but i fail again and again and again.
sorry to anyone who read this jumbled mess, but i feel a bit like a self-seeking moaner and i'm truly desperate.
as people are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into new roles (e.g. university student), their existing feelings towards people become more intense.

snt1 feel like most people feel awkward and unintelligent when they first get to university, so you're not alone at university, and i really recommend you get some counselling services appointment at your university, snt2 but it doesn't really matter if anyone tells you you're depressed or not, snt3 you have some obvious problems, and you can have some support, snt4 you have some problems, but you can have some support, snt5 it's not as important as your experience, snt6 meditation and exercise are really helpful, so try to do them, snt7 but you have to engage with help and general life to get somewhere, snt8 a lot of people feel like this, and hopefully this will pass when you begin to feel better, snt9 you're not kind to yourself, that's only going to make you feel worse, snt10 kind to yourself and get some help.
good luck
i think a lot of people feel the same way as you but are medicated by using their friends, i don't think that is the solution but it is definitely better to be around your friends when you are depressed than alone and depressed, either way if you fancy a chat feel free to message me privately.
if you are me, i focus on the idol. you aspire to someone who comes from a bad background and ends up succeeding, happy, having a family, marrying, etc. but you don't want to be them.
you focus on what you have achieved in life, you don't state what you studied or indeed why you studied it, because you want the experience, because your mum wants you to go, because you need a degree for the career you want,
so either way, you sum up why you're there and work your butt off to get the best grade you can, because when you get your degree you have something to say like " hey, i didn't fail, i worked hard and passed "
x.
i hope this helps.
i'm not pretty much autistic (i don't think i was misdiagnosed, i was just walking on my toes all the time)
it's more comfortable for me.
who makes the decision that a walk on toes is an autism signal, since it seems so random and not always indicative?
well i could have something that signals something on the autism spectrum but who knows how many?
you guys know what i mean.
walking on the toes could be a symptom of autism.
headaches can be a symptom of a brain tumor.
feeling tired a lot could be a symptom of leukaemia.
the symptoms are not always applicable, but it is worth noting in this instance as it is clearly inferred from the instance that a lot of cases have symptoms, so without the note, there would never be a diagnosis.
i'm walking on my toes but it's because i'm bearing with strange under-curled toes that had to be surgically straightened two years ago.
my brother is autistic, but i didn't notice it either, the spectrum is so broad, and i probably have a mild form of asperger's, which is why i have communication problems and don't pick up on social/body language.
then i don't have the proper diagnosis and you might even have some symptoms but that doesn't necessarily mean you have a certain condition.
i don't walk on my toes because i'm told not to for years and years so i don't walk on my toes much.
i have dyspraxia.
so you could be dyspraxic or have short tendons.
i've drill it to the dancers/gymnasts/ballet people etc. now i find it more comfortable.
i've read too much about random symptoms that resemble that.
hello, i'm a 12 year old girl addicted to self harming (2 days after i'm 13).
i started slitting my fingers with scissors at the age of 7 and never stopped from that day on.
it's gotten worse because i have a scar on my leg from when i slit it open stapling my ex boyfriend's name because i didn't stop the cut when i was bleeding.
i have several slits in my arm.
they healed and i then cut myself with a staple and razor blade that i had robbed from school.
i took around 5 paracetamols and other drugs and took them with lager and vodka, there was no way i could find a cutting tool.
i'm really tempted to cut my arms or burn myself to death while writing this.
i'm an addict, i'll cut again when one heals.
i think about it every day.
i'm 12 years old and my life is already sickening me.
this is from a graphic i made for my dad when he left me at 7 years old and didn't want to know me anymore.
he just cares about his little new girlfriend and his wife and his new life that i don't want.
my best mate died when i was 10 years old.
i am in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and have been forbidden to speak to him because of the events and the age difference.
my mum also suffers from bipolar and i have depression.
i don't want to stop.
i don't care what i do, i want to do it over and over again to torture myself, i hate myself.
but i love my best mate to bits, he means the world to me and if he did anything i would do anything.
i didn't tell him but he found out.
i don't want to hurt him, he doesn't want to hurt himself.
what do you mean?
thank you for reading.
are you on any drugs or do drugs get any therapy?
talk to your school nurse or your gp and tell them what's going on.
your trusted teacher may be able to tell you who it is.
if you tell them, they might be able to help you.
if you keep it bottled up inside, it's only going to get worse.
i trust you, the best thing to do is get this thing as early as possible instead of letting it even worsen.
don't do this.
i'm 17 and i started self harming (mainly cutting my arms) last year but i stopped a few months ago.
it's hard but you can do it.
i feel so much happier but seeing the scar reminds me of how i felt at that time and how strong that feeling was and that's why i want to do such things to myself.
it's also strong, you can do it, i found salvation by writing poetry and keeping a journal.
self harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
remember, self harm is not a defining characteristic of who you are.
you can overcome it.
so i thought i got a form of ocd because i found myself always checking my belongings to ensure i didn't lose or leave anything behind when i go out especially to university, which i did last year.
i have to check every 2 go's often and then after 30 seconds i cann't resist checking again for some reason.
what caused this?
or am i crazy or something?
it is often the case that it carries many things, but rarely carries any, and even checks many times a day, is this any extent of ocd?
what can i do with this?
i get very anxious if i don't check, often anxiety that causes me not to be able to wait that long.
i feel doomed if i lose my wallet or phone.
i just wish i could go out without worrying about leaving something or losing something every two minutes.
i really don't know what to do, and i'm afraid of going to a general practitioner.
they probably never heard of some compulsion like this and i just don't know what to do.
do any of you have a ritual like that?
people think i'm crazy but it's very strange how you get yourself out of this.
what advice can you give me?
i used to do this on my way to college, and had a list of items i knew i had, and used to compulsively check on the bus.
i have more severe anxiety now and think this is a warning sign, so just try to wean yourself off the habit when it's relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor, but also don't tell them to keep checking this thing out.
don't worry about that, the doctor saw a much worse case.
i did ocd in a psych class today, lol
you just avoid compulsive acts, so don't check to see if you've lost something, just leave it.
your ocd levels will gradually decrease over time (hopefully disappearing over time) but your anxiety levels will increase over the duration.
that just sounds like you're anxious overly instead of having a really bad ocd.
i get up every 20 minutes at night to check that all the locks in my house are particularly locked.
sometimes i am convinced they are not locked, but i know they are.
i think it becomes a real problem when the obsessive interruptions from your routine for the day really start to become a problem.
you definitely aren't crazy so don't worry and i'm sure your gp will understand the issue.
i also went for therapy for other reasons and they encouraged me to pick a number less than 20 to check on and stick with and cut down.
i think my idea is to teach, and i'm still ok if i check 5 times or 20 times.
i'm a lot better so far, and i definitely think anyone who wants to improve will.
i'm usually pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and i'm not too worried about it.
but i found myself becoming really anxious about the thing before now, in the last one to two months, and i'm not talking about mere nervousness from the blue, i'm talking about really anxious.
i'm beginning to feel panicky, not about things i've worried about before but about things i've not worried about too much, even things that have crossed my mind as something that caused alarm bells to ring in my head.
i'm not sure whether this is because of this lifestyle change (students on free care going to unemployed graduates) or whether this is a sign of other issues, but this is beginning to bug me because it affects my confidence and happiness.
i spoke it to a few people, including my parents, but all think i'm going through random phases and should hold off on acting until the serious problems are cleared up.
so what is the best thing to do?
you speak to the doctor and see if there is a possibility of taking an anti anxiety pill off the edge of things.
do i see myself speaking to a counselor?
or should i take the advice of the people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem?
well, i would not start trying to eye your anxiety, it will make me tense and more likely to panic more, there is a circle of death there.
i would recommend that you try to focus on something that will guarantee you a smile or make you feel happier when you start to feel a bit panicky.
or if you cann't do that, you get your friends to make you laugh when you start feeling panicky, lol it works for me and i suffer random panic attacks lol
i just started to really worry about the tiny things, although they don't sound as severe as you, but i just started to worry about them.
i find just talking to someone else about the things that make you anxious helps.
i find it makes me feel better that i can mention my worries to my mum and see her react to the situation in a calm way as i would recommend, and that makes me feel better about the thing i'm worried about, knowing it's not a big deal and i don't need to be anxious about it.
but if it worsens, go to the doctor.
i have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that prevents him from leaving the house and doing things because he is so worried that something might go wrong.
the doctor gave her medication and it made her much better.

it won't take long.
route 288, a circumferential highway that runs around the southwest quadrant of the richmond-new urban region, opened in late 2004.
it has already changed the developmental pattern due to worsening and caused localized traffic congestion around its exits.
the richmond times-dispatch tells the tale of the impact of the huguenot trail in powhatan county today.
will jones reported that traffic on one section of huguenot trail has more than doubled since the opening of 288.
speed and accident deaths are also surging.
so far this year, 17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of winterfield road and up to 12 accidents all year.
resident engineer dale totten of the virginia department of transportation noted that the road would have four lanes if they had more money and would cost about $ 13 million.
of course, vdot doesn't have the money to construct roads in the richmond region.
because vdot spent all their frigging money on 288 because of local politicians and boosters.
where is homer simpson when you need him?
doh, this is a major moment.
we predict that route 288 will generate residential development in the scarce populated area around all of the exits, overtaxing a local country road.
other people choose where they work and where they live, but limited access highways can relieve traffic for drivers back and forth between chesterfield and goochland counties.
and they create traffic congestion in new places.
i'm only surprised at how rapid this is happening.
i even think it could be 3 or 4 years.
think about it, route 288 has already created this road at a cost of $ 13 million just at this one exit.
another predictable thing.
road improvements soared after a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of a megaproject at the intersection of 288 and a major road.
well, we may see by the end of the decade that liability for the unfunded highway has zoomed well past the $ 400 million that the original highway took to build.
the idea is that such a great idea is being thought of by a brainiac named route 288.
thanks for nothing.
i think we could spend 4 billion elsewhere better.
i think you shouldn't blame 288 for creating those people.
what's the alternative if they're not enough to create new traffic congestion in the new places?
will traffic be congested in the old place as well?
now you understand what tmt in fairfax feels.
i usually take the road position.
288 is definitely excessive, but there are glaring needs in other parts of the state.
richmond has virtually no traffic.
the rush hour lasted 30 minutes.
and you give them the beltway through a large rural area.
road to nowhere.
just think, this money could be spent on another potomac river crossing or on desperately needed road improvements in nova.
insult to injury, the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in last year's budget deal, and that's the icing on the cake.
very nice of you all to oblige us.
but there is not much sense to it.
the same problem has been around for ages.
if you get ahead of the need, you are the cause of sprawl.
if you build in places where there is already an acute need, you cann't pave your way out of congestion.
anonymous
that's a fair point.
5:26 made a good point.
but this situation hammers home the validity of the auditor's report that found that the ctb and vdot funds for transportation projects were based on the best lobbying, not on a comprehensive state transportation plan.
i have submitted this intolerable and disgraceful situation.
and chichester and his toadies are pouring more money into this flawed institution, making it worse.
what is the purpose of expending transportation funds?
in virginia it is for the benefit of private business plans, not for public interest.
you're dead wrong.
walter stoch stated that the money intended for economic development would not be paying for 288.
come on folk.
tmt, i don't understand your point.
how long have you been stuck in traffic last time you weren't destined for or from some sort of business?
it seems to me the whole purpose of the roads is to facilitate the public's interest in getting into and from private business.
business support is overwhelming, but it's sunday, grandmother's trip, and of course a soccer game.
we wouldn't be suffering from congestion problems if our road expenditures didn't not match the increase in business or domestic or state products.
if we recognize the primary benefit of roads is to business, then we should do two things.
businesses should pay more for what they pass us of course, and we should incentivize them to locate where they will stress the system the least, even if that means more overall travel.
why is it so hard to understand?
to solve the problem of the functional pattern of the human settlement and the balance between the transport system's capacity and the travel demand generated by land use.
all else is spin.
emr
tmt said it was for the benefit of private business plans and not for public interest in virginia.
i don't see the point of this state's statement because it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else.
i think they are intertwined and tightly so because they are virtually the same.
the problem is local because this cookie dough is lumpy.
but eventually, if we demonize business long enough, we will find that all of our work is with the devil.
i don't see the point in claiming that the solution is to balance the dynamic, ever changing, nature of the environment.
you even see positive rail to dulles because it's a job center and promotes bidirectional demand.
i agree.

i would say the same logic should be applied to roads.
they should have a destination at the end of both so we can use our investments to the maximum.
we need more places to get closer to the balance that we need, as you say.
reality check here.
i drive past watkins landing every morning and evening.
i commute back and forth to my work location on huguenot trail.
i never saw anything remotely like a traffic flood.
it's 55 mph in a zone where cars are going 75-100 mph in the morning.
huguenot trail is already in the planning stages to be widened because of heavy development demand from the chesterfield side, a new school, and a whole bunch of existing developments that have been zoned in for years (and funneled through robious road)
288 is wonderful for those of us who actually use it instead of the bottleneck that lack of 288 is for powhatan and western chesterfield.
we can develop commercially and work closer to our lives.
you might think that's irrational land use, but...
i don't desire to live in any city.
i refuse to work in downtown area.
i refuse to use mass transit that is unsafe for female commuters who work long hours outside of regular work hours.
and i would like to see a lot of large developments happen.
i don't understand exactly how i'm keeping horses on a quarter acre lot, supposedly.
a gallon of gas could go for $ 10.
and i still pay my living in the country.
many people legitimately prefer horses, hunting, gardening, and certain small businesses over living in the core of the urban.
this infatuation with city living truly baffles me.
anonymous 6:37, if a person wishes to live in a country, they have every right to do so.
but you are not right that the rest of the state should underwrite a 4 billion dollar highway construction to make shopping and getting to work easier.
in the debate over 288, the other things that could be spent on were consistently overlooked.
if the money is applied to other pressing road projects or even to non-road projects, much of the traffic congestion can be alleviated.
ray hyde, my comments are directed at investors who lobby for roads to be placed near their own property and incompetent systems that fund these requests regardless of whether they are linked to a master transportation plan or not.
