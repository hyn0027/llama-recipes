never go back to that time when we appeared humiliated when signing the treaty, china is strong, the sword must be sharp, the knife must be shiny, we must bury the approaching enemy.

i agree with the analysis of the person who started the thread. if a real war comes, i will be hua mulan to protect our home, defend our homeland, spread our chinese prestige, and pledge to fight to the death to defend our national dignity.
i wish i could bear that passionate upsurge of mao zedong's long march to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all the enemies of china and spread our dragon's prestige.
how long have we tolerated japan?
i say fellow citizens.
hello everyone, we all know about the september 18 th incident, but japan now has plans to premeditate another similar incident at sea, another lugou bridge incident at sea,
surprisingly, japan defied the strong condemnation of the whole world and openly invaded our sacred territory, the diaoyu islands.
diaoyu islands have always belonged to china, we all know that, it's because of historical reasons that what originally belonged to us has become controversial.
fellow citizens, i ask you, what is it that we are? why is there a need for negotiation? japan has gone even further, they want to create a fact of occupation. can we allow this? absolutely not!
i say to my fellow citizens, the japanese militarism brought grave disasters to the asian people.
china suffered from japanese ravages for several decades long.
the japanese unit 731 experimented on chinese, korean and other people with extremely brutal methods on human bodies in the northeast cruelly and cruelly, the nanjing massacre added a layer of blood that will never fade away in the ancient capital; over 1,000 kilometers away from hengyang and changsha, the big and bloody battles barely left the bones of the dead, and everything was killed off.
i have too many instances on record that are difficult to exhaust all the bamboo strips, fellow citizens, that can not be cited for the heinous crimes committed by japan in china.
just like those millions of deceased souls who lost their lives, wandering over the pacific ocean, finding it difficult to rest in peace.
all those who experienced that era still remember it vividly, and even our younger generation also cries down a stream of tears from our cheeks, and boils with indignation at any time we turn the page of this historical page and read it.
actually, japan now wants to reverse the verdict on its aggressive history, so it has woken up fellow citizens and chinese in asia.
we must go forward, although it is painful to look back at these 100 years of shame, we must create history and choose history, but the historical issues are not resolved.
responsible is the reason we have no fear, the territory is small, but it relates to the matter of dignity, the interests of the country and the nation are guaranteed, regardless of how the wind and cloud changes, we can not let our native land be separated, although it is scarred with wounds.
fellow citizens, i say that the advent of the 21 st century means that the chinese nation is at a time when we are beset with difficulties from within, but are being pressed from without, and we face many challenges.
how should we go about the taiwan, tibet, south china sea, surrounding environment and aggressive foreign forces of china issues?
fellow citizens, i ask: what is to be done? please look at the world map and see how the crescent encirclement suppresses our breathing, strangles our development, and covets our national territory.
we never fear people, we don't want to make enemies, but we are not afraid of war, we don't want war.
we must urgently arrange our arms and strengthen all our military forces on land, sea and air.
china has never had the ambition of expanding its territory outward, but for several thousand years, china has flourished as a nation.
we will not impose on others what we ourselves do not want, so we will follow the strategy of foreign security philosophy of benevolence and virtue application.
like individuals, countries are tolerant and liberal, but we have to insist that we willn't hurt ourselves, so we must avoid hurting others.
tolerance is not certain fear, sincerity is not certain cowardice.
china's exemption from japan's war repair caused by world war ii serves the benevolent peace.
i say to my fellow citizens, the people's heroes monument is a condensed history of china's nation that is striving to continue to improve.
the solemn and magnificent posture represents sacred expectations of peace.
from time to time, my memory string is agitated by the many heroic and tragic scenes that come to mind: the shining spears and armored horses.
my thoughts go from that yellow page of history to the kangxi emperor who, alone in his audience hall a hundred years ago, contemplated how he achieved the unification of the territories, and also abraham lincoln, who, alone in the great hall, wandered in the dark, thinking of the integrity of the union, the former u.s. president.
yes, it is certainly dangerous to forget the war in a peaceful world, but i say to my fellow citizens, we must never exercise forbearance blindly with our wants, we want development and peace. the boxer protocol, which is a betrayal and humiliation of the nation, has aggravated china's poverty and backwardness in modern times, and falling behind has led to bullying.
how come peace is not strong?
we must focus on education for national defense, build up a great wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people, and establish a full-range, capable attack and defense system for national defense.
best defense is good offense: strengthen our force that can engage in long-range attacks, and improve our deep and great combat capabilities in all aerospace; increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate modernization and internationalization of military equipment, and establish high-quality elite high-tech divisions on the premise of avoiding the influence of national economic development;
the battle horns are about to sound, people are fully equipped and ready to go.
without the support of the people, we accomplish nothing, but with the support of the people, we are all powerful.
i say to my fellow citizens, time and again we have said no to other people, and that is what we have to do.
1. establish a guarantee fund, improve the working environment and working mechanism, and recruit hundreds of thousands of it professionals who have lingered in the united states and around the world back to china.
2. create a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
3. manufacture 5,000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds.
4. accelerate research and deployment of high-speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles, which could break missile defense systems.
5. nuclear experiment resumed, military force established in space
6. retain 1,000 nuclear bombs (equivalent to 100 million tons of trinitrotoluene) and install nuclear warheads on all short- and medium-range missiles as needed.
7. retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
8. abandon your commitment to not first use nuclear weapons.
9. retain the right to preemptive strike in the face of national security threats.
fellow citizens, i say, if we only have confidence and improvement, we can strive to be strong. qin shi huang unified china, zheng chenggong recovered taiwan, we must carry on the far-sightedness, insight and strong will of our predecessors.
now that piece of land that trembles far away from motherland's embrace and moans and calls, let us fellow citizens carry forward what the previous generations wished for but was not fulfilled, let us move forward courageously, carrying forward what the previous generations wished for but was not fulfilled.
reading history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmered, and the nation is concerned about me. although i am clothed in a gown and included in the common people, i willingly serve our country as a volunteer to make our motherland prosper and once again be splendid, and i have no regrets even if i die. my showing my sincere and patriotic heart to heaven is adequate.
i composed this poem here in the classical form of ci to voice the aspirations of my heart.
paint your lips deep red.
protect the diaoyu islands.
we lost our ryukyu islands in a bitter way.
how can we allow diaoyu islands to fall into other countries?
100 years of vicissitude.
smoke and cloud chase flying waves.
the youngest brother is still a tender youth.
wandered all directions and the seals were bear.
flag looked over.
we brandished our weapons and crossed east.
let the horses drink from the pacific ocean.

<a href="http://www.amren.com/mtarchives/2008/08/the_other_article.php#comment-110649"> title: the other article </a>
why aren't we fighting little japan?
what still tolerated by the chinese people?
they even ride on our heads.
still, the gutless chinese are doing this?
we should tell the whole world that china can not be bullied at will.
time to show our strength, china has been too calm for too long.
citizens' lives are all too careless currently, officials are extravagant too.
we don't have cohesion now already, china needs to start a war, the faces of the countries that follow the us rear are going to be harshly slapped.
let them know the us isn't a panacea; if we win, china's influence can increase; and improve citizen cohesion; if we lose, we can clean out the incompetent bureaucrats and make trash get out; let china have new blood and update; get china up.
china, go!
i suggest that china strengthen the guard of diaoyu islands, guard it every day, and protect the fishermen and our country's sovereignty. if japan dares to invade our territory by military force, we will fight a small-scale war to defend ourselves, regardless of the cost. china can not lose.
we need to show life, but really, you showing yourself as someone who is embraced by someone...
i just passed by.
this is what the whole society, including the stars, resemble.
damn, not sexy.
it cann't be totally accepted.
just a cheap entertainer, their reputation in feudal china is somewhat sensible.
their lives looked glorious.
a group of nine professionals.
life is hard.
shocked
that's normal, and whores are always heartless and unrighteous performers.
they want money, not face.
look at the wolf near ms. fan with glasses, you know that if the actor is not forced out or even not even framed, he must drink with him.
son of a bitch
as long as there's something lovely to eat, it's okay.
no one is easy, life is like a show, you have to look at the script to know how to perform.
all of them.
top scorer in the imperial examination in life, all 360 degrees of the walk, so much effort and endeavor behind him, this humiliates the word " bean vermicelli. "
haha.
overdoing
reality.
shoot that hooligan.
cheap performers.
cheap performers.
the entertainment circle is dirty, all the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
pity them, but who's to blame?
everybody does this, how can you make money if you don't?
when a woman is in front of other people, she is proud, but when she is alone, she is melancholy.
in ancient times, the popular prostitutes were just the stars nowadays, they are now famous prostitutes, so it is just normal for them to drink or even sleep with some high officials.
stop talking to other people, just behave.
what should we do in the future? we're facing such a hard choice too? is it enough to be successful alone?
there is no dispute that the suffering is more, it is undisputable that the glorious look is disguised.
it's not so bad because they're just playing in their own circle, they don't see or keep in mind anything.
but there is an old guy named zhang jizhong who behaves like a hooligan in his circle and thinks he is virtuous without talent, he makes a tv series when he has nothing to do to wreck the whole country.
both took what they needed.
when will china have a pure and innocent girl?
now the story is very shocking in the entertainment world. rumor has it that hsu yuki was forced out because she refused to drink with guests arranged by the company and was obliged to switch to working as a lawyer's assistant to make an end meeting instead.
superstars often encounter social engagements or circumstances they do not welcome but must join in.
they cann't decide on many things after all because it involves many aspects and the interests of many people.
sometimes, a very normal dinner party for us, which we imagine would be like that for a star, cann't be that simple.
the star has a lot of contracts and if he tackles well his source of money will roll in, if not she will come to her heels, either way she will be forced out or even framed.
there are two smart female stars, one of them holds a very high integrity, and sternly rejects all such invitations.
the second kind of person is good at playing tricks and achieving their objectives with their own seed money.
rumor has it that even some super-female stars have won their first roles this way.
after drinking some alcohol, the advertiser or sponsor of the show may have a chance to lie on the shoulder of the female star, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, and the endurance of the female star is the attitude most adopted by her.
they are very low-profiion people in 9 professions.
those stars are just pretending and actually living a damn good life much better than this.
just a cheap entertainer, their reputation in feudal china is somewhat sensible.
agree.
oh well, the actors aren't easy to translate.
they deserve it, they asked for it.
nothing is easy for me, it's dawn.
women are birds and beasts, and men are worse.
brawk!
brawk!
it's not that long.
route 288, a circumferential highway that runs around the southwest quadrant of the richmond-new urban region, opened in late 2004.
it has already changed the development pattern, causing the localized traffic congestion around its exits, and will worsen it.
the richmond times dispatch tells the tale of the impact of huguenot trail in powhatan county today.
will jones reported that traffic on one section of huguenot trail has more than doubled since 288 opened.
speed and accident surges as well.
so far this year, 17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of winterfield road, up from 12 all of 2004.
dale totten, a residential engineer with the virginia department of transportation, noted that if the state had more money, it would cost about $ 13 million to add four lanes to the road.
of course vdot doesn't have the money to construct roads in the richmond region.
because vdot spent all their frigging money on 288 because of local politicians and boosters.
where is homer simpson when you need him?
doh! this is a major moment!
we predict that route 288 will generate residential development in the scarce populated area around all the exits, overtaxing a local road.
others choose where they work and where they live, but limited access highways can relieve traffic for drivers back and forth between chesterfield and goochland counties.
and they create traffic congestion in new places.
i'm only surprised at how rapid this is.
even i think it could be 3 or 4 years lag.
think about it, roads create all their own exits, so why would route 288, which has already cost $ 130 million to construct just at this one exit, be liable for all the exits it creates?
another predictable thing.
after a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of a mega-commerce project at the intersection of 288 and a major road, the need for new road improvements soars.
well, we may see liability for the unfunded " zoom past the original $ 400 million take for the original highway building by the end of the decade.
the idea is that of a brainiac who thinks that route 288 is such a great idea.
thanks for nothing.
i think we could spend $ 400 million better elsewhere.
i think you shouldn't blame 288 for creating those people.
if they have enough to create new traffic congestion in a new place.
additional traffic congestion in the old place?
now you understand how tmt in fairfax feels.
i usually take the pro-road position.
288 is definitely excessive, but there are glaring needs in other parts of the state.
richmond has virtually no traffic.
the last hour of rush hour is 30 minutes.
and give them a beltway through a large rural area.
road to nowhere.
think you can just spend this money on another potomac crossing or on desperately needed road improvements in nova?
insult to injury, virginia centrist, the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in last year's budget deal, and that added insult to injury, wiped out the debt.
it would be very nice if you all obliged us.
but there isnt much sense to it.
same old problem.
if you get ahead of need, you're accused of causing sprawl.
if you build in places where there is already an acute need, you cann't pave your way out of congestion.
anonymous
that's a fair point.
5:26 is a good point.
but this situation is hammering home the validity of the auditor's report that the ctb and vdot funds for transport projects are based on the best lobbying, instead of on a comprehensive state transportation plan.
i submit this situation is unacceptable and a disgrace.
and chichester and his toadies are pouring more money into this flawed institution, making it worse.
what is the purpose of the transportation expenditures?
in virginia, it is for the benefit of private business plans, not for the public interest.
you're all dead wrong.
walter stoch stated that the intent of the money for economic development was to pay for 288.
come on folks.
tmt, i don't understand your point.
when are you going to get stuck in traffic last time you didn't go to some sort of business?
it seems to me that the whole point of the road is to facilitate the public's interest in getting into and from private business.
there was overwhelming support for business, but it was sunday, grandmother's trip, and a soccer game of course.
we wouldn't be suffering from congestion problems if what we expend on roads didn't not match the increase in business or state domestic product.
if we recognize that the primary benefit of roads is to business, then we should do two things:
business will pay us more of course for the transportation bill and we will incentivate them to locate where they will stress the system the least even if that means more overall travel.
why is it so hard to understand?
to solve the functional pattern of human settlement and the balance between the transport system's capacity and travel demand generated by land use.
all else is spin.
emr
in virginia, it is for the benefit of private business plans, not for the public interest, tmt said.
i don't see the point of this statement as it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else.
i think they are intertwined and tightly so that they are virtually the same.
this is a local problem because this cookie dough is lumpy.
but eventually, if we demonize business long enough, we will find that all of us are working for the devil.
i don't see the point in claiming that the solution is to balance the dynamic, ever changing, nature of the problem.
even you will see the positive rail to dulles as it is a job center and will promote the bidirectional demand.
i agree.
in fact, that may be all that is necessary, in that that is the reason for its being built.
i would say the same logic should be applied to roads.
they should have both ends destinations to use our investments to the maximum.
we need more places to get closer to the balance you say we need.
reality check here.
i drive past watkins landing every morning and evening.
i commute back and forth from my work location on huguenot trail.
i never saw anything remotely like a traffic flood.
it's a 55 zone, but there are 75-100 cars in the morning.
the road, huguenot trail, has already been planned to be widened because of heavy development demands in chesterfield, a new school and a whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned years ago and were funneled through robious road.
288 is wonderful for those of us who actually use it instead of bottlenecking powhatan and western chesterfield due to its lack.
we can develop commercially and work closer to our lives.
you might think that's using land irrationally.
i don't desire to live in any city.
i refuse to work in the downtown area.
i refuse to use mass transit that is unsafe for female commuters who work irregular hours.
and i like the idea of a large lot development.
i don't understand exactly how i'm supposed to keep a horse on a quarter acre lot.
1 gallon of gas could go for $ 10.
and i still pay for living in the country.
many people legitimately prefer horses, hunting, gardens, and certain types of small businesses, which make them not want to live in the urban core.
this infatuation with city living truly baffles me.
every person has the right to live in a country if they wish to, anonymous 6:37.
but you have no right to expect the rest of the state to underwrite the construction of a 4 billion dollar highway so that shops and getting to work will be easier.
in the debate over 288, it was consistently overlooked that there are other things that could be spent on that cost $ 400 million.
if the money is applied to other pressing road projects or even to projects that god forbid are not roads, much of the traffic congestion could be alleviated.
my comment is directed at ray hyde, investors who lobby for roads to be placed near their own property and the incompetent and unfunded system that ray hyde is a part of.
i'm 24 and my mother is 2.5 years old.
i've been broken up with my son's father since august.
i want to start dating other people and my son's father said that if i do, he has nothing to do with me.
he is very possessive and controlling, but that is not right because we are together.
right now his life is going on too much and he thinks we can work, i've told him several times i don't love him and he doesn't love me.
i want him there with his son, he doesn't need me either.
but he has no one, his family don't get along with him and they have issues.
i don't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he's around the more miserable i am.
i don't want him there without his son, he's either a good father or at least trying to be.
i believe every child needs both parents, whether they are together or not.
but he thinks that if he cann't have me, no one can.
what am i to do for my life?
it is very bad when your ex-significant other threatens you using your son.
you cann't give in to that, it just escalates if you do.
you have the right to live your life and be happy, so you have no reason to cave in to his threats.
he would see his son regardless, if he really loved him, but this is just the typical method of control that people like him use.
other people are saying things like " if you leave me, i'll kill myself " - will it get through to you?
date:
meet all kinds of people.
do what you want.
if you had been better off without him, you would probably be more so if he had volunteered to walk out of your and his life.
i agree, one other thing, if you date him, he's not in business.
i didn't tell him.
he didn't threaten you, he didn't care about your personal life.
can you document his threats?
you really need this.
quit taking his calls and make him leave voice mail.
make him email or text you.
keep that record.
get a lawyer and divorce.
try to get legal aid if you can not afford one.
tell your ex-significant other that all communication needs to go through a lawyer.
the bus driver, the people till, and the people delivering your food want exactly that change.
do they not realize that you don't get a pile of change from the bank?
someone has to take notes somewhere?
people get lazy.
i would like to be as near as possible, i dislike counting copper all day.
if you take a 20 pound note on the bus they'll just tell you to get on the bus because they're as lazy as hell.
it is not legal to pay a certain amount in a load of coins, for example you can only pay 30 pence using a one pence coin.
hello, i started uni in september but obviously i didn't gel with it immediately like most people.
i know it's going to take some time for me to adjust, though, because i'm very introverted, shy, especially anxious, and all the rest of it.
on my first night here, all my housemates and i went out and it was the hardest thing i've ever had to do.
when i'm sober i go to the student union bar by myself.
point is, here's the fact: more points.
i didn't enjoy university after about 5 months here, i was disillusioned by the course, didn't enjoy the set project and didn't like the delivery of the course much.
the university is making out much better than it seems.
i started badly, and student finance is delayed, adding to my stress levels, i'm so worried i cann't progress with my work, so it's all piled up, and concluded.
i was assigned a counselor through the university, saw him for about 5-6 weeks in a block session, and honestly, it didn't really work out because i never opened up to him.
only half hearted.
i'm loaded to the neck with work, have to hit major deadlines, depressed and the anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time.
i have no counsel anymore, you can only have them at a time, and i doubt they'll help me this time if they haven't already.
i lack motivation, i don't feel comfortable with the people lecturing me, i feel like i want to give in but i cann't because i end up in a dead end job and aspire to be someone.
i'd rather die than be uneducated and not live the life i want to live, and by dropping out of university i've made matters worse.
i'm 21, turning 22 this year, i don't have much time to fail, i have to do something.
i failed college once, and did another course to try to get into university, but...
could someone advise me some?
maybe you can go and see your doctor and see if there is any way you can extend your deadline to try and ease the pressure a bit?
send an email like this post to your tutor, they will consider mitigating circumstances, don't worry, they have seen all before, i know, i used to work in the university administration department.
break your work into manageable chunks.
concentrate on one bit of work at a time (obviously start with the most urgent assignment).
don't shut off your housemate and do well, try new things from the very beginning, keep it now.
i would recommend you go see your doctor too.
speaking to someone can benefit you if you are always an anxious person, my friend got therapy from the nhs for anxiety, it's really normal.
try to get an extension, if you're honest, i'm sure your university will allow it.
it's hard to keep strong and keep on living.
my mum divorced, she had a horrible time with my stepfather and she was sent round the bend by her new found freedom.
she has epilepsy and manic depressive with huge anger problems.
she is constantly horrible to me.
at home i cann't cope with her bursting out and her hateful nasty remarks.
at the point of my break i was an 18 year old with a 95 % bursary studying full time at a private school with high pressure in 6 th form.
i cann't work from home because she shouts at me.
then i got angry at my teacher for that.
one minute she's lovely, like i've got my mummy back, and then the next minute she's turned into the most spiteful human being.
i didn't pass my a2 exams and i've already accepted that i've been defeated and that this year of my life is going to make me fail.
i don't know if i can come back, but the university has offered me the most amazing offer, but i cann't even accept it. i've never made a grade in my life.
i wish i could wipe her out from my life, it would be so much better without her.
but then i think i'm just selfish.
but surely this is not what my life is like, is it?
it should be better by so much.
but i feel like i'm out of control of this downhill spiral.
and i don't know what to do.
thank you for reading.
nice vent.
you cann't get her sectioned for that.
even has she a history of mental illness or a diagnosis?
you sure don't know that you didn't get a good grade, so you'd accept a place if possible.
life throws things at you all the time.
if you are not part of your family, then you are an outsider.
i had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for 8 years before i came to university, and honestly, that's the only reason i'm here.
if you really want out, work hard.
really, if she cann't give you consistent support, you need it from somewhere else.
can you call childline or something like that?
you can go to the library on saturday and study there for 8 good hours.
can you go to your friend's house to form a study group?
the section is a bit painful in the ass and you blame it for all your problems, so do you want to have her section?
i know how you feel.
my mum spits from hell too.
i would highly recommend taking up smoking.
oh tsr grew up and stopped nagging, it was a joke.
i think i became much weaker and duller in my personality between 1-2 years ago in order to try and befriend some people at uni.
but being overly nice leads people to believe they can say or do whatever they want to me, hell, they can say or do whatever they want to me.
they showed absolutely no respect.
for example, i say hello to someone from the university and they ignore me, but 30 minutes later they decide they want my help with some work and i give it.
it's caused a lot of anger and distress in my life and it's really starting to affect my concentration at university.
has anyone got any experience of handling things of this sort or how to go about getting some respect back again?
just say no.
if it is particularly uncomfortable, do it gradually, otherwise you willn't be able to do it.
you could start with " sorry i'm not but i'm busy "
of course you wouldn't go over the top in translating it, you wouldn't go completely the other direction.
if you think about it, " no " is what you're going to say, no matter what.
when they start to realize that you are not going to bend over backwards for them, they start to respect you more.
this is really such a bad attitude, well, you can be respectful of course, but not to the point where you just let them do anything to you, that's not nice, that's foolish.
i don't know if anyone is reading this, but i just feel despair and i feel like i need to tell someone.
i left home in september and started university. i am incredibly anxious about doing this, but i delayed thinking about it until i got here. i am here now and have been for over two weeks. i feel overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward.
since moving to secondary school i have struggled emotionally, i lost my dad around the age of 9 and used to always blame it on how i felt, i have had two periods of counselling in my life, one from 091200 to this year around march.
i feel momentarily overwhelmed by the problems in my life that are uncredible and make me doubt my self-esteem (which has always been low and i doubt it ever will be more) and i cann't concentrate on work, i often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions and i doubt about anything and everything.
my two counselors did not diagnose me with depression and suggested i was not suffering from it, but i was and am huge worried about it because my dad died of it and committed suicide.
i've tried to solve my problems before and found that exercise and meditation were particularly useful, i've also tried things like self help books and tapes, generally i feel that this is how i should be living, but i generally feel that this is not how i should be living, i'm wasting one chance at existence and one chance at being a young man.
i simply don't know what to do, and i never follow through when i think i know what to do. my friends often say i'm lazy, and i cann't disagree a lot of the time. i feel like they're trying to do everything they can to help, and i fail time and time again.
sorry to anyone who read this jumbled mess and i feel a bit like a self-seeking moaner but i'm truly despairing.
when people are in new situations and feel pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into new roles (such as university students), their feelings for people become more intense.
i am not a health professional and can only speak from my own personal experience, so i strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional for your depression and worries.
snt1 (feel) most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to university, so you are definitely not alone there. snt2 (recommendation: i really recommend you get an appointment with the counseling service at your university. snt3 (it doesn't really matter if anyone tells you whether or not you're depressed, you'll have some problems obviously, and you might be able to use some support. snt4 (you're having some problems obviously, and you might be able to use some support. snt5 (meditation and exercise are really helpful, so try to do that. snt6 (however, you have to engage with help and with life in general to get somewhere, but don't beat yourself up if you feel unmotivated to do anything at the moment. snt7 (a lot of people feel like this, and hopefully this will pass when you begin to feel better. you're not the only one feeling like this. snt8 (kind to yourself and get some help.
good luck
i think a lot more people would feel the same way as you, but they are medicated using friends, probably not such a solution, but definitely a good thing to be around friends when you are depressed rather than alone and depressed, either way if you fancy a chat you can message me privately.
if you are, i focus on idols. you aspire to someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful, happy, with a family, married, etc. you don't want to be them, but someone you admire and respect.
you focus on what you have achieved in life, you don't state what you studied or why you studied it, you want the experience, your mum wants you to go, do you need a degree for the career you want?
you sum up why you're there and work your butt off to get the best grade you can either way, because when you get your degree you'll have something to say like " hey, i didn't fail, i worked hard and passed "

i hope this helps.
i'm not pretty much autistic, i'm not diagnosed with dyspraxia, i think the doctor misdiagnosed me, but i walk on my toes nearly all the time.
it's more comfortable for me.
who makes them decide that walking on toes is a sign of autism, when it seems so random and not always indicative?
well i can have a thing that signals something on the autism spectrum, but what about one or two?
you guys know what i mean.
walking on toes could be a symptom of autism.
headaches can be a symptom of a brain tumor.
feeling tired a lot could be a symptom of leukaemia.
symptoms are not always applicable, but if they are a lot of the time (clearly in this instance) then it is worth noting as it would never have been diagnosed otherwise.
i used to walk on my toes but now i walk with strange toes that have to be surgically straightened, which happened two years ago.
my brother is autistic, but i didn't notice it either, he's so broad spectrum and probably has mild asperger's (i have communication problems and don't pick up on social/body language reactions).
but then i don't have the proper diagnosis and you might even have some symptoms but that doesn't mean you have a certain condition.
i've been told for years that i don't walk on my toes, so i don't walk on my toes much.
i have dyspraxia.
so you could be dyspraxic or have short tendons.
i've drilled it to the point where i find it more comfortable now.
i don't read too much about random symptoms like that.
hello, i'm a 12 year old girl (2 days from now i'll be 13) who is addicted to self harming.
i started slitting my fingers with scissors at age 7 and never stopped from that day on.
it's gotten worse because i have a scar on my leg from when i slit it open stapling for my ex boyfriend's name because i wouldn't stop cutting and bleeding.
i have several slits in my arm.
they healed and then i cut myself out of the staples and razor robbery from school.
when i couldn't find a cutting tool i took around 5 paracetamol and other drugs and took them with lager and vodka.
writing this, i'm really tempted to cut my arms off or burn myself.
i am an addict, i will cut again when one heals.
i think about it every day.
i'm 12 and my life is already sickening me.
this is from a story i wrote about my dad leaving when i was 7 and not wanting to know me anymore.
he just cares about his little new girl, his wife and his new life that i don't want.
my best mate died when i was 10 years old.
i am in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and have been forbidden to speak to him because of the age difference and the events that have happened.
my mum also suffers from bipolar and i have depression.
i don't want to stop.
i don't care what i do, i want to do it time and again to torture myself, i hate myself.
but i love my best mate loads and he means the world to me and if he does anything i will do anything.
i didn't tell him, but he found out.
i don't want to hurt him, he doesn't want to hurt himself.
what do you mean?
thank you for reading.
are you on any drugs or do drugs get any therapy?
talk to your school nurse or gp and tell them what's going on.
your trusted people, who you can tell about, are school teachers.
if you tell people, they can help you.
if you keep it bottled up inside, it's only going to get worse.
trust me, it's better to get this thing as early as possible instead of letting it even get worse.
don't do this.
i'm 17 and started self harming (mainly cutting my arms) last year, but stopped a few months ago.
it's hard, but you can do it.
i feel so much happier but seeing the scar reminds me of how i felt at that time and how strong those feelings were and why i wanted to do such things to myself.
also strong, you can do it, i found it saved by writing poetry and keeping a journal.
self harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
remember, self harm is not a definition of who you are.
you can overcome it.
i've been thinking i've got a form of ocd because i've always found myself checking things that belong to me to ensure i haven't lost or left anything behind whenever i go out, especially to university, so i find myself thinking i've got ocd.
i often have to check every 2 nd go and then after 30 seconds i cann't resist checking again for some reason.
what caused this?
or am i crazy or something?
it's often, but rarely, carries many things, and even checks it still daily, is this ocd to any extent?
what can i do about this?
i get very anxious if i don't check, but often the anxiety is so much that i cann't wait that long.
i feel doomed if i lose my wallet or phone.
i just wish i could go out without worrying about whether i left something or lost something every two minutes.
i really don't know what to do and i'm afraid to go to a general practitioner.
probably never heard of some compulsion like this, and i just don't know what to do.
do any of you have similar rituals?
people think i'm crazy but it's very strange how difficult it is to get out of this.
what advice can you give me?
i used to do this on the way to college back in the day, had a list of items i knew i had and used to compulsively check on the bus.
i have more anxiety now and think this is a warning sign, so just try to wean yourself of the habit relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor, but also tell them not to keep checking for this thing.
don't worry about that, the doctor saw a much worse case.
in my psychology class today we were talking about ocd (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ocd"> ocd </a>) so i did a graph about it.
perhaps the best way to avoid compulsive acting is to just avoid it in the first place, so don't check to see if you've lost something and just leave it.
your anxiety levels will gradually decrease over time, hopefully disappearing over time, but your anxiety levels will increase over time.
that sounds like you're just over anxious, not that you have ocd really bad.
i am obsessed to the point of getting up every 20 nights to check that all the locks in my house are particularly locked.
sometimes i am convinced they are not locked, even though i know they are.
i think it becomes a real problem when obsessive interruptions really start to interrupt your daily routine on a daily basis.
you're definitely not crazy, so don't worry, and i'm sure your gp will understand the issue.
i also go for therapy for other reasons and they encourage me to pick a number (obviously less than 20) and stick with it and cut down.
i think teaching is a good idea, and i'm still ok if i get checked 5 times or 20 times.
i'm doing a lot better than i thought i would, and i definitely think anyone who wants to improve can.
i'm usually pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and not worry too much about them.
but i found myself becoming really anxious about things over the last month or so and i'm not talking about mere nervousness from the blue.
i began to feel irrationally panicked about a variety of things that i hadn't worried about too much before, and which i didn't even come to mind as something that caused alarm bells to ring in my head.
i'm not sure this is what caused this lifestyle change (going from a free care student to a graduate unemployed) or if this is a sign of other issues, but it has begun to bug me because it is affecting my confidence and happiness.
i spoke to a few people, including my parents, about it, but all think i'm going through a random phase and should hold off on acting until it's clear there's a serious problem.
so what's the best thing to do?
speak to your doctor and see if there is any edge taking anti anxiety pills can take off?
i see that i might be able to speak to a counselor?
or should i take the advice of the people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem?
well, you should not start trying to keep an eye on your anxiety, because that will make you tense and more likely to panic, and there's a circle of death there.
i would recommend that you try to focus on something that will guarantee you a smile or make you feel happier as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky.
or if you cann't do that, you get your friends to make you laugh when you start to feel panicky (lol) it works for me and i suffer random panic attacks lol
i'm just starting to get really worried about the tiny things, although it doesn't sound as severe as you are.
i find talking about what makes you anxious just helps me, not someone else.
i found it a perhaps not un-moaning way to find that i was not only not worried about the things i was worried about, but that my mum was reacting to the situation in a calm way that i would recommend, and that made me feel better about it, so i knew that it was a big deal, but that i didn't need to be anxious about it.
but if it worsens, go to the doctor.
i have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety which prevents him from leaving the house and doing things because he worries so much about what might go wrong.
the doctor gave her medication and she made much better.

some 2500 university students formed a human chain in osaka sunday to protest the u.s.-led military campaign in iraq.
" we cann't forgive this war, " 20-year-old rally organizer miyako fuji told jiji news.
i want to join together with each of us as individuals who oppose the war to feel together.
news agency jiji said protesters carrying placards reading " stop the war, " " love and peace, " exceeded the number of people expected to show up at osaka castle park in downtown osaka, carrying out a human chain formation after 3 p.m. (6 a.m. gmt).
the protests followed a string of other protests involving tens of thousands of peace activists across japan since january.
78 of 100 surveyed opposed military action in iraq, according to a kyodo news agency poll released saturday.
a separate poll of 1,846 adults published in the yomiuri newspaper tuesday showed that 64 percent of the respondents felt that japan has no choice but to back the united states, while only 12 percent said that japan has every reason to back the war.
britain's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown named the current head of the country's energy regulator on tuesday as the new chairman of the financial services authority's (fsa) financial watchdog.
former senior banker callum mccarthy began a job that is one of the most important in the london financial world in september when incumbent howard davies stepped down.
davies left to become chairman of the london school of economics, one of the best known parts of the university of london.
brown said mccarthy would bring " non-rival " combinations of public sector experience, senior industry practice and highly successful regulator chairman to the federal security agency.
mccarthy is currently head of the office of gas and electricity markets, the british energy industry's privatized regulator.
mccarthy, who previously held senior positions at barclays bank, barclays investment bank and kleinwort benson, is a former civil servant with the department of trade and industry.
in november 2001, the financial services authority became the sole british regulator of financial services, taking on various functions from nine separate agencies, watched over by davies.
at least three members of a tribal mob were hacked to death in the northeastern indian state of tripura on thursday for allegedly practicing witchcraft, police said.
spokesman said that on wednesday a group of 25-30 armed men attacked a house belonging to a quack doctor in the village 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of the state capital agartala in tripuras.
three members of a family were dragged out and killed with machetes and spears before the mob fled the area, a spokesman said by telephone from agartala.
the quack doctor, nityalila naotia, 55, and his teenage son, and another unidentified member of the family, died.
the spokesman said naotia was a practicing sorcerer and had cast evil spells on the villagers with his black magic, prompting the village group to eliminate them.
police arrested 4 people in connection with the killing.
in parts of tripura and other northeastern states of india, superstitious beliefs, black magic and demonology are integrated into tribal customs.
many tribes practice a faith that mixes black magic and superstition.
30 people died in a week of seasonal rain in oman.
muscat, april 19 (reuters)
police said 30 people, including five indians, four pakistanis and a family of united arab emirates swept away in a car, died in a week of heavy seasonal rain in oman on saturday.
seven people were killed when the wadi overflowed due to rain in the wilayat region near the uae border, police spokesman abdullah al-harthy said.
five indians and four pakistanis died, according to officials from the two countries' embassies.
the decomposed body of rajasthan state, western india, construction worker dharam datt choyal was found on friday, said bhupinder singh, first secretary of the indian embassy.
two indian workers were still missing after choyal's truck was swept away in monday's flash floods in the capital muscat.
police reported 16 people had died since the rain began two days ago wednesday.
the sun is back out on saturday and traffic is running normally in the capital.
meteorologists said it seemed the wet spell that started with a bang on monday was ending.
the largest market in muscat, muttrah souq, reopened on saturday after being knee-deep in floodwaters for three days.
a pakistani court in the central province of punjab sentenced a christian man to life imprisonment for blasphemy, police said on sunday.
district court judge shahid rafiq in faisalabad found ranjha masih guilty of defiling verses from the koran at a 1998 rally by the minority christian community in protest.
they said that the judge had also ordered ranjha to pay a 50,000 rupee (about 870 us dollars) fine in a verdict handed down on saturday.
ranjha is accused of tearing down a billboard carrying verses from the koran in the city of faisalabad after christian demonstrations and after the city bishop committed suicide in 1985 over a blasphemy law.
bishop john joseph of faisalabad, a catholic, shot ayub masih, a christian, in the head outside a court in sahiwal in 1998 while the judge was convicting ayub masih under the law.
ayub masih was charged in 1996 with blasphemy for allegedly defending british author salman rushdie, whose novel the satanic verses infuriated radical muslim clerics who accused rushdie of defaming islam.
last year, pakistan's supreme court acquitted ayub masih, who denied uttering words against islam or the prophet mohammad.
blasphemy is punishable by death under pakistan's penal code.
however, blasphemy convicts have never been executed in the country.
christian rights activists say the main use of the anti-christian law was to persecute christians or settle land feuds.
the beleaguered french media group vivendi universal said friday it had advanced negotiations to sell its theme park business to a us firm for around $ 1.5 billion.
the report comes as creditors say they plan to sell off vivendi universal entertainment's (vue) us unit and other assets to focus on telecoms and its french cable tv business.
the times said vivendi universal was negotiating to sell its flagship theme park to new york-based investment firm blackstone group in the first step in dismantling its entertainment empire.
no immediate comment was available from a vivendi universal official in the united states.
blackstone group has reportedly bought vivendi's theme park division, which includes universal studios hollywood and universal orlando in florida, and the company's interest in owning parks in spain and japan, according to a report in the paper, which sources close to the buy negotiations told the paper.
blackstone already holds a 50 percent stake in two of universal orlando's parks.
vivendi confirmed this week that it had been speculated in the press for months that it planned to shed its entertainment assets, including the famous movie studio universal and its television assets, before the end of the year.
at a general meeting tuesday, chief executive jean-rene fourtou told shareholders that the sale of vivendi universal entertainment is a major goal for 2003 and that negotiations are already underway.
fourtou says he has not yet received a firm offer from the giant us music group, universal music, but has not taken a final decision on its future.
once a utility group and france, the group must reshape itself to slash its huge debt of around $ 180 billion.
the group recorded a net loss of 23.3 billion euros in 2002, the biggest ever in france.
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom stressed wednesday that qatar's role in the middle east peace process is " crucial " during talks with qatari counterpart sheik hamad bin jassem bin jabr al-thani in paris.
shalom told a joint press conference that the relations between the tiny gulf state and the recently appointed palestinian prime minister mahmud abbas could boost peace.
we are discussing the process of middle east peace.
shalom said we will assert to the arab and israeli parties that both sides will do everything to return to the negotiating table over the course of one hour of talks.
qatar is a very important country in this issue.
he said he knew of a special relationship between qatar's foreign minister and abu mazen.
since taking office as israel's foreign minister on february 27, shalom has had his first meeting with an arab counterpart.
qatar has economic links with israel despite not maintaining diplomatic relations with israel and faces criticism from other arab countries over the links.
shalom later flew to london to talk to british prime minister tony blair and foreign secretary jack straw.
on tuesday, the white house said president george w. bush told canadian prime minister jean chretien in a telephone call that he looked forward to seeing him at upcoming summits, including with major industrialized nations and russia.
bush spokesman ari fleischer said the two leaders discussed the upcoming g-8 meeting, us-canada relations and other international issues during multiple days before the june 1-3 summit in france.
both said they looked forward to seeing each other in evian.
fleischer said they also touched on afghanistan, the situation in the democratic republic of the congo and the global economy.
amid chill in relations with iraq's opponents, bush has not definitely postponed a visit to canada, instead choosing to host australian prime minister john howard, who has endorsed the military campaign in iraq.
chretien told reporters monday that he and bush will discuss a wide range of issues, including iraq, the upcoming group of eight summit of the world's most powerful industrial nations, and aid to africa, which bush hasn't spoken to him about since late february.
we're always on good terms.
the canadian leader said we just disagree on one item.
india's natural suffering is the reason the prime minister and president are bachelors, opposition chief provincial party told an election rally saturday, according to a report.
the times of india newspaper quoted prime minister atal behari vajpayee and president abdul kalam as saying that digvijay singh, the madhya pradesh state minister in central india, had offended the hindu rain god varuna by remaining a bachelor.
the country is ruled by a bachelor president and a prime minister who is unmarried.
singh said the hindu scriptures say this is not a very auspicious time and it will cause widespread heatwaves and droughts.
he added that the status of bachelor of president kalam, instead of prime minister vajpayee, had made the country arid and unfertile.
pramod mahajan, the general secretary of the ruling bharatiya janata party of vajpayee, retorted that singh's statement was contemptuous.
india reels from heatwave since mid-may that has killed 1403 people

the skeleton of the second baby was found in a rural wisconsin home where a 22-year-old woman's dead infant was discovered in a plastic blue container on june 8, officials said monday.
kristin scott's mother told police that scott had given birth to two babies, one unknown sex in april 2001 and another full-term girl on january 14, at her parents' home in byrds creek, richland county.
saturday, police arrested her in abilene, texas, where she moved with her friend on june 2.
she was held on $ 50,000 bail on charges of reckless homicide and hiding a corpse when an infant was born in january.
scott told police she didn't tend to the baby and it died 30 minutes later.
she said the baby must die, as per the criminal complaint.
after going to look for the source of the foul odor in their house, william and nancy scott found the decomposed body of their first baby in a closet.
according to the complaint, scott told investigators that he had moved that body from time to time from the closet in his house in byrds creek, to the trunk of his car, and to a closet in his apartment in richland center.
the sheriff has not released other details about the second baby.
palestinian security forces returned to their positions in the gaza strip on monday, after israel removed all major checkpoints in the coastal territory, according to a palestinian security source.
police officers who enjoy their freedom of movement without knowing since the intifada exploded in september 2000 took up positions across gaza, sources said.
palestinian police took over all posts and positions held before 28 september 2000.
since the start of the intifada, they have been the first to move in cars and weapons, said the source.
the move marked a step forward in carrying out the huge middle east roadmap, backed by the united states of america, aimed at ending the months of bloodshed and creating a lasting peace between israel and the palestinians.
police took up positions there and in the neighboring town of beit lahiya, following israeli troop withdrawal from the northern town of beit hanoun late sunday, he said.
they also deployed along the israeli border.
the palestinian authority must be credible on handing over, as it is obliged to show what the business is when the hardline groups are being reined in who are plotting attacks on the jewish state.
almost three years after the first intifada allowed palestinians to circulate freely on the trans-gaza highway, another one has begun, this time by the israeli army, as troops have abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastal territory.
traffic flowed freely after the army's withdrawal at the netzarim junction south of gaza city, near the kissufim junction near the central gaza strip town of deir al-balah, and at the guest house junction just south of gaza city.
three military checkpoints along the entire length of the gaza strip transformed a 30-minute ordinary ride from south to north into a two-hour or three-hour grinding ordeal, coming to symbolize the horror of occupation.
israel has implemented most of the agreement, except for a few issues, according to a source who pointed out that israel still has not removed the two military observation posts at the kissufim and guest house junctions.
he said several other roads remained temporarily closed but movement was free along the trans-gaza highway.
the eastern-west road, karni-netzarim, and a section of the highway that passes just south of the guest house junction and is close to kfar darom settlement are still closed, he added, saying they are likely to open in the coming weeks.
another road leading to the southern border town of rafah from the city of khan yunis opened after up to 10 days, he said.
israeli military sources confirmed that troops had installed a gate at the netzarim crossing and the guest house junction south, in response to palestinian complaints, but said the troops were only there when jewish settlers needed to use the road.
the ban on allowing palestinian men under 35 to move freely will be lifted, but only after monday or early tuesday, but it will still be a forced move.
the palestinian source said the army also handed over control of the rafah border crossing, which straddles the gaza strip and egypt, to palestinian people.
six palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the palestinian section of the border crossing, which israel troops took over shortly after the start of the rise-up.
the oslo accord of 1993 granted the palestinians autonomy measures, but required joint management of the rafah border crossing with egypt by israel and the palestinians, with israel having final control of the zone.
israel has been occupying the palestinian section for more than two years, but the crossing between the two territories is open in principle, but frequently closed for reasons rarely explained.
witnesses said 5 iraqi civilians, including a woman, were killed monday when their house was hit by a missile fired by a us-led coalition warplane.
they said their house was located in one of baghdad's most populous areas, al-azamiyah district.
one house was destroyed in the strike and casualties were removed from the area.
the us-led coalition launched a new round of air strikes in baghdad at 2:30 p.m. monday (1130 gmt), a us official said.
they said there were huge explosions in different parts of the capital baghdad and air raid sirens sounded in the city and added that iraqi anti-aircraft artillery began to fire back.
at least 130 iraqi civilians have been killed in the 5 days since the war started, but coalition leaders have repeatedly assured that they are making every effort to minimize civilian casualties in the current iraq war.
other reports reaching here say 5 syrian bus passengers were killed and 10 others injured sunday morning when the bus was hit by a us missile near the syrian-iraqi border.
the vehicle was carrying syrian refugees fleeing the war in iraq.

lack of precautions blamed for avalanche accident in northwest china.
menyuan county, china, april 5, northwest.
the search for the two missing outdoor tourists in qinghai, china's northwest province continued on tuesday, and lack of precautions left one dead, which is the main reason for the tragedy.
deng haiping, head of the state administrative mountaineering organization in charge of rescue operations, said the six tourists had no experience climbing snow-covered mountains and knew little about the terrain.
there are six members in xining, the capital of qinghai province, who are all members of outdoor sports clubs.
of the three survivors, lu shimin said the first two climbed such mountains.
deng said they had no compass, altitude measuring apparatus, or special communication equipment, let alone the usual equipment used for mountain climbing.
he also said that the bold idea of the snow sliding was the cause of the deadly avalanche.
six people were injured in an accident on saturday afternoon when they slid down from a height of 3,700 meters on daban mountain in ertanggou, menyuan hui autonomous county, haibei tibetan autonomous prefecture.
3 survivors of the avalanche reported to police who started rescue operations then with the help of villagers.
one body was found early sunday morning.
hong kong headquarters of the rescue organization said one of those listed as missing was in hong kong, but his identity was undefined.
deng said he can take the id card with him and his mandarin name is only hung zhihua and the local government will try to find out his identity with the hong kong special administrative region.
five rescue teams have been dispatched to search for the missing person and more than 140 rescuers are now involved in the operation.
deng said that thick snow and new avalanche signs have hampered rescue work.
deng said we found no clues but two helmets in the last three days.
officials in los angeles are mulling ways to accommodate people evacuated by katrina.
los angeles, september 6
los angeles county and city officials will try to determine tuesday how best to accommodate at least 2,000 evacuees expected to be brought to the gulf coast after the katrina aftermath.
officials said los angeles county supervisor gloria molina and los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa will assemble key members of their administrations over the labor day weekend to assess whether the county and city can host thousands of displaced families who survived the disastrous hurricane.
molina and villaraigosa committed to taking at least 2,000 evacuees.
local officials announced earlier this week that a task force of city and county of los angeles personnel will be created to assist survivors of katrina with transitioning for the long term.
the california state emergency office, federal government, city and county departments and non-profit organizations such as the red cross coordinated local efforts.
the county and mayor supervisors jointly activated the los angeles county emergency operations center to prepare for an intensive response involving assistance to evacuees.
dozens of people have already traveled from louisiana and alabama to los angeles county, and are being sheltered at the dream center, a non-profit agency.
new task forces are being prepared to assist with shelter, support services, information and coordination of private sector assistance to find evacuees a more permanent house as soon as possible.
molina and villaraigosa called on the private sector and non-profit organizations to help provide needs for children and families coming from the los angeles area.
at least 33 people have died in floods in rajasthan state.
new delhi, aug 22
the death toll from the floods in rajasthan touched 33 as five more people were swept away in the past 48 hours in the desert state where nine districts face the fury of monsoon rains.
the situation continues to be bad in udaipur, dungarpur, barmer, pali, sirohi, jalore, kota and jhalawar districts.
over 1,500 villages and towns in this district continue to be submerged.
in some places, the continued rain has also hampered relief operations.
electricity and telephone networks were disrupted in areas affected by flooding and widespread flooding affected road and rail networks.
the schools and colleges in udaipur, the lake city, are definitely closed.
chief minister vasundhara raje said the situation was still grim in the flood-affected areas.
the chief minister said the flood situation was improving slowly and less water was flowing towards the dam where it was constantly discharged.
raje said an assessment of losses caused by the floods would be done soon and a memorandum would be sent to the indian government seeking assistance for rehabilitation and relief operations.
the indian army continues operations in the flood-affected areas of the state and has dropped food packets by helicopters in the affected areas.
7 dead and 98 injured in china's east tornado
hefei, july 4
the disaster relief authority said that seven people were confirmed dead and 98 others injured in the tornado that hit the eastern chinese city on tuesday.
the state disaster relief office said wednesday in a press release that seven bodies, including three in renhe township and four in qinlan township, were found in the debris of collapsed buildings.
all the injured villagers were treated at the local hospital.
one of the 10 seriously injured people is in critical condition, the doctor said.
officials calculated that the tornado, packing winds of 100 kilometers (60 miles) per hour, still caused damage in the eastern chinese city of tianchang in the anhui province, destroying more than 100 homes and forcing the evacuation of at least 1,100 people from three villages.
vice governor of the province zhao shucong led a relief team to tianchang in the morning wednesday, promising relief funds, materials and medical assistance.
many chinese provinces have reported disastrous weather in recent weeks as floods hit the country's center and south while drought persists in the north.

yichang, hubei province, april 20
local authorities said about 200 people were evacuated on sunday night, threatened by a massive ongoing landslide in central china's hubei province.
head of the xingshan land resource bureau du honghui said that 200 people, including teachers and residents, were evacuated to a middle school in gaoyang city.
continued rain triggers slides of 60,000 cubic meters of land.
the 2,000 cubic meters of mud caused rock mud to flow into the nearby primary school and the village with 37 homes.
as of 22:00 sunday, the ground floor of the classroom of the teaching building of gaoyang primary school center, which had all the windows, pupil desks and chairs damaged, was covered with a deep layer of mud 1 meter away.
the playground was inundated with mud 30 to 50 centimeters deep.
du said the rescue effort was underway and the situation of the landslides was being closely monitored.
no casualty reports because primary schools don't have classes on weekends.
since monday, the authorities have decided to suspend primary school classes for three days.
up to 106 mm of rain has fallen so far.
weather forecasters say the rain will continue in the coming days, continuing to swell the underground water exuding from the landslide site.
disaster relief staff expected the area of landslides to worsen due to bad weather.
two people were killed by up to 141 millimeters of rainstorms over the past three days in hubei province.
as the motorcyclist passed the bridge, he was swept away by the current.

survivors of nargis recount the tragedy of nargis.
yangon, may 13 (reuters)
survivors of some of the storms recounted bitter experiences of the recent cyclone nargis, which struck their home region hard, coming in the aftermath of the cyclone to seek shelter in yangon with relatives after the storm struck their area.
survivors from the southern myanmar town of laputta, who escaped death from nargis with much hardship, said they had experienced a terrible human tragedy.
survivors from the farming village of pinzalu, deep in laputta city, said pinzalu had stood the hardest hit, with total collapse of houses and a 20-foot high tide wave caused by cyclone storms.
he said that if he had two young daughters to carry, he would try to swim to escape and one of them died shortly from the violent storm.
he had no alternative, but he abandoned his daughter to die in the waves and tried to keep afloat for a long time by holding on to a fallen branch nearby.
he cried out because when the storm winds stopped for a moment, he found another of his daughters dead in his hand.
he recalls the tide wave sweeping his parents away at the start of the tragedy and being left alone to live his life.
he said the storm waves had swept away many others in his village in a similar manner, and he added that he had walked to laputta afterwards, where he witnessed all the houses in the village under water on the way.
he tried to survive the hunger by drinking coconut fall juice because he did not find drinking water and food when he faced the hunger.
another woman villager told local media that she escaped by staying on the roof of the hut but was struck by falling bamboo caused by the wind.
the storm swept away overnight any strike-standers who couldn't.
she said she had walked through laputta and seen many people die on the way and estimated that three quarters of the people in her village had been killed by the storm.
she described only five people remaining alive in the nearby village of yway ywa.
a woman teacher from yay wai ywa village spoke to the local weekly eleven news and added that most of the dead were women.
she said the whole village would be crying in the storm if the world was devastated and some members of the family would die in a series of lying on the road.
she exclaimed, " i didn't find any dependents in laputta, but i'm resting in some spoiled pagoda pavilions with shelters.
she said she had to queue for it but some well wishers donated millet gruel.
local doctors are worried about hygiene issues, as the disposal of urine of tens of thousands of homeless people has developed into a health threat also in the view of health, as the disposal constitutes a threat to the bodies of tens of thousands of unsettled dead.
cyclone nargis, the deadly tropical cyclone that killed hundreds over the bengal bay and covered coastal towns in the ayeyawaddy state, including haing gyi, pathein, myaungmya, laputta, mawlamyinegyun, kyaiklat and phyarpon, and 45 townships in yangon, the biggest city and the one that sustained the heaviest casualties and infrastructure damage, on may 2 and 3, severely hit five divisions and states, namely yangon, bago, ayeyawaddy, kayin and mon.

islamic republic of iran
international; weapons; politics; proliferation; energy
the international atomic energy agency has reached agreement with iranian officials stating that there are no remaining issues or ambiguities regarding iran's nuclear program and activities.
u.s. and european officials suspect that iran's civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials suspect iran is masking efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs under iran's civilian nuclear energy program.
u.s. and european officials could impose a fourth round of sanctions on tehran as the u.n. security council is likely to consider iran's nuclear program in september 2007.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) distributed limited copies of a publication copying iaea reports before a meeting of 35 members of its board on 070911.
the findings reflect the agreement reached in tehran on august 21, 2007, which iranian officials began publicizing in the week of august 12.
the accord says there are no issues or ambiguities regarding iran's nuclear program and nuclear activities.
a reuters news account said the iaea report said the step was a significant step forward in the work plan.
a senior u.n. official was quoted by reuters as saying that iran's efforts to enrich uranium were slowing.
the iaea report stated that iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of the country's present and future nuclear programs.
iranian officials stated on august 30, 2007 that iran would cooperate with the iaea to prevent further rounds of international sanctions.
iran's representative to the iaea, ali asghar soltanieh, stated to the fars news agency in tehran that the report emphasizes that there is no indication of diversion of iran's nuclear activities and that all of iran's nuclear material has been audited.
some non-proliferation experts stated that the iaea has ceded too much to iran.
in a criticism published august 19, 2007, david albright and jacqueline shire of the washington-based institute for science and international security, a group of arms control experts, wrote that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards and that the agreement does not specify that iranian officials provide the iaea with access to key people, facilities and documents needed to verify that the iaea has the answers to its questions.
independent experts stated that iran's last agreement with the iaea to grant inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information was short of the west's demand that iran halt production of highly enriched uranium which could be used in a potential bomb.
u.s. state department spokesman tom casey stated that iranian officials have no international obligations regarding the nuclear program but that the report may offer some new details or insights into iran's development of the program.
casey stated that the nuclear program continues to move forward, showing that the iranian regime continues to defy the international community.
most western non-proliferation experts stated that the agreement of 070821 contained little that would dissuade policymakers in washington, london, paris and berlin from moving another round of security council sanctions forward.
experts stated that many of the previously unresolved issues of transparency should be resolved.
daryl g. kimball, executive director of the washington, d.c.-based arms control association, said the agreement addresses the problem of iran's pursuit of enrichment technology and capabilities that could lead to the production of nuclear material for a bomb.
kimball stated the iranian government is designing to deflect criticism and pressure and claim progress.
iranian officials stated that more sanctions could reduce the possibility of collaboration between officials and inspectors.
the security council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on iran, but the penalties demanded by the u.s. are limited because of pressure from china and russia.
soltanieh stated in an interview with iranian state-controlled television that the report and the measures made any other international organization irrelevant and unjustified in intervening.

the document outlines israel's proposal to allow international transfer of nuclear technology through organizations such as the nuclear suppliers group.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india from nuclear trade restrictions.
israeli officials have convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines that would allow international transfers of nuclear technology to states that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
india, israel and pakistan are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade, including purchases of reactors or uranium fuel or yellowcake.
the document outlining israel's proposals was distributed to the 45 members of the nuclear suppliers group in march 2007.
israel's presentation was made on a paper that did not allow for official denials.
the chairman of the nsg said in a letter that israel's presentation was offered in the context of the nsg's debate on the indian official's bid for exemption on march 17, 2007.
only india and israel among the non-signatories are qualified to admit to the nsg, according to the proposal.
israel's plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-treaty states in the nuclear field.
one criterion indicates israel's status as a non-declared nuclear weapons state and says that nuclear trade with israel should be allowed if israel applies stringent physical protection measures, control measures, and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons, all nuclear facilities, all nuclear material, and all special nuclear material within its territory.
the document circulated on capitol hill in september 2007 as the bush administration worked toward an agreement with indian officials.
arms control association executive director daryl kimball stated that the israeli document could possibly affect the debate over india.
kimball stated --
at the nsg, officials from india and the united states do not want obstacles to india's largest and the united states' most powerful country.
reaching a consensus on india at the nsg meeting in november 2007 was difficult.
israeli proposals gave some officials reason to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
israel's record of following international nuclear rules is good and better than india's.
the bush administration rejected an israeli proposal despite ties between the israeli and u.s. governments.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india from nuclear trade restrictions.
president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice view the pact as an important part of the bush administration's foreign policy legacy.
the deal is controversial in india and will have to be approved by congress.
the delay in winning approval for the india deal could negatively affect the administration's foreign policy legacy with the most negative effect being the delay in the election year.
state department spokesman tom casey stated that the u.s. government views the india deal as unique and does not see it as a precedent for any other country, including israel.
israeli embassy spokesman david siegel said the suggestion that the israeli government demand exemptions or link the effort to any other issue, including the india debate, was grossly inaccurate.
seigel stated --
the israeli government has never asked the nsg for an exemption from the nsgs guidelines on nuclear supplies, nor has it ever made a specific request for israel.
israel is recognized as fully adhering to the nsg guidelines.
the israeli government urged the nsg to consider adopting a tiered, generic approach to the transfer of nuclear technology based on criteria.
some nsg officials previously suggested an approach similar to israel's plan.
the non-proliferation regime would be considerably enhanced if the nsg guidelines were modified in the manner proposed by israeli officials.

ahmadinejad announced that iran's uranium production capability has been expanded.
iran has refused to commit to halting expansion, but has hinted that a halt could be in the future.
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in mashhad northeast iran on july 26, 2008 that iran will expand its arsenal of centrifuges to produce enriched uranium over 5000.
ahmadinejad stated that the expansion was the first since april 2008 when iran announced its approach to implementing 6000 centrifuges.
iran has articulated a goal of 50,000 centrifuges operating at the enrichment plant near natanz.
international community demands that iran halt nuclear material production.
the number of centrifuges cited by ahmadinejad differs from media reports.
iranian news agencies reported that ahmadinejad stated that iran has 6,000 working centrifuges, but subsequently removed the statement from the internet.
iranian news agencies stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100,000 centrifuges.
experts discount the significance of ahmadinejad's claims because of the absence of information on the function of the centrifuges.
western diplomats speaking anonymously in tehran said the number of centrifuges was less important than whether the machines were operating and efficient, and that ahmadinejad's assertions were hindering resolution of the diplomatic standoff between iran and the west.
new america foundation arms control expert jeffrey g. lewis stated that new america foundation is aware of iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but does not know the status of the machines' operational status.
diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems have hindered iran's enrichment program.
iran repeated its assertion that its nuclear program is aimed only at producing electricity, as it contradicts islamic principles.
the us, israel, europe and the majority of western experts on arms control believe that iran is pursuing the capability to produce a bomb immediately if it decides to do so.
experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple.
ahmadinejad stated that the west is still pursuing negotiations after iran resisted the west's demand that iran halt its nuclear activities.
eu foreign policy chief javier solana has recently presented iran with two offers.
incentives to cease production of enriched uranium, which the us has endorsed.
for six weeks during the prenegotiating period, iran will not add centrifuges and the west will refrain from promoting a fourth round of economic sanctions against iran to the un security council.
us officials repeated their statement that negotiations can not begin before iran halts all enrichment-related activities that can be verified, but the bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze and dispatched burns to geneva.
on july 26, iran refused to respond to solana's offer in geneva talks attended by us undersecretary of state for foreign affairs william j. burns.
the talks constituted the highest level of diplomatic contact between the us and iran in nearly 30 years.
solana, burns and the european envoy set a deadline for iran to respond positively before they initiate new sanctions, including a prohibition on selling iran vital refined petroleum products.
iranian officials refused to commit to stopping the expansion or observing deadlines.
ahmadinejad appeared to suggest on july 26, 2008 that iran could potentially halt the expansion of its higher than previously expected number of centrifuges over a six week period.
ahmadinejad stated that the west consents to the existing and operating centrifuges between 5000 and 6000 if the number of centrifuges is not increased.
5000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear material for a power plant or atomic bomb if highly enriched.
6,000 centrifuges running continuously could produce weapons-grade uranium in 6 months to make one bomb.
in may 2008 the international atomic energy agency stated that iran possessed 3500 operational centrifuges.

the paris diplomatic meeting concluded that further steps to pressure iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility would not be agreed.
on 14 november 2008 a diplomat stated to the media that at a meeting in paris on 13 november 2008 united states officials, european officials, russian officials and chinese officials had not reached agreement to take further action to persuade iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility.
the process of enriching uranium is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants and produce fissile material for atomic weapons.
the meeting on november 13, 2008 ended without new measures being announced.
the french foreign ministry released a statement after the november 13 meeting in which it declared that the statement reaffirmed the importance of a dual-track approach of engagement and working towards sanctions.
russia and china resisted new sanctions against iran.
russia and china are closely tied politically and economically with iran and do not feel domestic pressure to act against iran.
the united states and iran are not closely tied politically and economically and iran feels domestic pressure to act against the united states.
russia and china hold veto power over security council decisions.
russian diplomat sergei ryabkov said at a meeting on 13 november that russia had not struck a deal on sanctions against iran and that western countries were in favor of sanctions but china and russia were against them.
ryabkov will attend the meeting on 13 november 2008.
a report released this week stated that iran has made significant progress on a heavy water research reactor facility near arak.
an iranian heavy water research reactor near arak could eventually produce plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons.
satellite images published by the institute for science and international security (isis) show significant progress in the construction of the heavy water research reactor (hrr) facility near arak from february 2008 to october 2008.
david albright stated that the heavy water research reactor near arak, iran, evaded notice from the international security community.
david albright stated that satellite images say that progress at iran's heavy water research reactor near arak has been significant and that the reactor has been progressing from building frame to a large finished facility over the past 1.5 years.
david albright, a former arms inspector and director of the washington, d.c.-based institute for science and international security.
iran stated that it will pursue nuclear technology for energy production and research purposes.
the united states and its western allies suspect that iran's nuclear production efforts preceded the creation of its nuclear weapons infrastructure.
low-grade uranium production is legal under international arms control regulations.
the latest iranian nuclear technology development shows the incoming barack obama's us foreign policy team with a complex and technical-diplomatic challenge in taking on the task of stopping iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
in the last month in power, the administration of president george w. bush managed to synchronize u.s. policy with the leaders of the european union, great britain, france and germany to press for tougher sanctions against iran and diplomatic action.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) is expected to release a report next week criticizing iran.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) is a nuclear watchdog agency of the united nations.
the hope that another set of un security council sanctions would be imposed before the end of president bush's term has decreased because no new initiatives emerged at the paris talks on november 13, 2008 regarding iran's nuclear program.
iran continues to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology while maneuvering diplomatically.
some israeli officials stated that iran's test firing of a two-stage solid-fuel rocket with a range of 1,200 miles this week alarmed them.

the russian high-security laboratory that stores anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria faces losing electricity because it lacks payment to the electricity utility mosenergo.
a large repository of deadly anthrax, plague and other bacteria is threatened by a loss of electricity, located 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of moscow at a highly secure russian laboratory complex.
a recent arrival of officials from moscow region's electricity utility mosenergo and threatened to turn off electricity because of lack of payment.
the complex of 90 buildings is a russian laboratory complex and served as the location of a secret biological weapons program during the soviet era.
the incorrect headline in the izvestia newspaper stated that the moscow region's regional depository was a threat to the city.
the virus is at the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
every kind of bacterium studied for use in the soviet union's secret biological weapons program is at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
there is a large repository of viruses in the siberian region.
russian and western officials stated that the power cut-off at the state scientific center of applied microbiology was unlikely to result in any public health threat.
russian and western officials stated that there is not enough certainty to know why the loss of power at the state scientific center of applied microbiology poses a public health threat.
nikolai n. urakov, a general, stated in a telephone call that the state scientific center of applied microbiology has a quite reliable system of protection in case of emergency.
nikolai n. urakov, longtime director of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the state scientific center of applied microbiology is working with western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedicine manufacturing site.
nikolai n. urakov, a general, said by telephone that the researchers at the state scientific center of applied microbiology were scared by this threat of sudden electricity shutdown, which he said was a kind of psychological pressure.
general nikolai urakov stated in a telephone call that scientists would have to destroy all ongoing bacteriological experiments if the power was shut down at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
general nikolai urakov likes the contribution of the united states and western countries of about 6 million dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex, which pays another 5 million dollars a year to pay electric bills and arrears of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
american scientists working at the state scientific center of applied microbiology, a close government research institute, stated that the russian government is responsible for paying the institute's electric bills.
western aid to convert one of general nikolai urakov's bioweapons laboratories peaked in 1997 after learning that iran had offered to purchase research experts from the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
knowing that the crisis is orchestrated by russian scientists and military leaders who are now dependent on western financing to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,
american scientist randall lee beatty is working to convert the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity at the state scientific and applied microbiology center is a crisis.
randall lee beatty is the director of the international science and technology center.
the international science and technology center (istc) has financed approximately half of the budget of approximately $ 10 million that has supported about 350 russian biowarfare scientists and technicians under the general nikolai n. urakov.
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific center of applied microbiology knew that it would not pay its electricity bill for 14 months.
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific center of applied microbiology is one of the world's most important locations for archiving dangerous pathogens and that it is a shame that the location was destroyed because of the lack of electricity payments.
approximately 3,000 strains of bacteria are stored at the state scientific center of applied microbiology and many others are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversized air-handling systems all dependent on electricity for function.
defrosting frozen-state preserved live germs is the greatest danger from the shutdown of the electric power at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
biological warfare expert raymond zilinskas of monterey institute of international studies stated that the main threat to the organism is the cut in power to the state scientific center of applied microbiology and not the possibility of its escape.
raymond zilinskas stated that in the worst case scenario, bacteria would be defrosted at minus 70 degrees and that the cleanup afterward would be a real mess because it is not certain that all the bacteria would die.
another example is mosenergo electricity utility confronting the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk, where the dangerously clashing of the basic capitalist imperative of enterprise self-sustainability with the old soviet-science weapon science remains.
the russian national power company cut off electricity at a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood on high alert because of an overdue power bill in 2000.
nuclear missile silos will not lose power.
arm troops marched to the substation and turned the power back on.
united energy systems, a national company, cut power at a number of military installations around russia in january and february 2001.
the kamchatka center for monitoring the russian space forces is one of the military installations that have lost power.
in most cases where military installations cut off electricity, restoration is quick.
the investigation showed that the utility-military tug of war often forces the military to spend electricity power budget funds instead of diverting money to other useful things.
building a residence in the country for the general is some of the budget cut funding.

brazil has implemented a law that allows the air force to target drug aircraft in brazil's airspace.
the us is concerned about liability if a civilian plane is misidentified.
brazil announced that its air force will begin shooting down aircraft used to traffic in illegal drugs in brazil's airspace.
the plan requires eight precautionary steps before an order to shoot down a plane can be issued.
prior to october 2004, the policy was to take effect late in the year, the publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they needed to file a flight plan.
the law permitting such actions was originally approved in 1998 but president fernando henrique cardoso never put the policy into effect.
the united states dissuaded cardoso from signing the decree because of concerns that the accidental downing of a civilian aircraft might expose the government and companies to lawsuits, the amr graph said.
in april 2001 the united states reduced its support for an operation targeting drug-running aircraft after a peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed a peruvian missionary and her child.
the relatives of the victims have sued the us government and won a settlement from the us government for providing intelligence and technical support for the operation.
a us state department official stated --
under certain conditions, the us law could forbid assistance to countries implementing the shoot-down law.
the us agrees with brazil's assessment that the threat from drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
the us government consulted the brazilian government on provisions of brazilian law.
brazilian defense minister jose viegas stated that brazil has encountered difficulties in securing us support for the plan but that recent bilateral talks have led to a certainty that the brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing brazil to commercial sanctions.
brazilian officials expressed hope that the us would endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
the us has scheduled 102 million dollars in drug aid and law enforcement aid for brazil for 2004.
former air force chief and current director of the air institute of the estacio de sa university in rio de janeiro, general mauro jose miranda gandra stated that the measure is a courageous step by the government, but that it could have more impacting and political consequences because of the restrictions imposed by the brazilian government on itself.
brazilian officials stated that the policy may not apply against aircraft with children on board.
viegas stated that there is a need for limits.
gandra stated that the provision undermines the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug smuggling aircraft carrying children, thereby introducing the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
viegas stated in an interview in brasilia that the government would use the law to more powerfully dissuade drug traffickers from entering brazil's airspace, feeling that the air force would not pose a threat to them previously.
the deteriorating public security situation in sao paolo and particularly rio de janeiro, with increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs, has prompted the government to act.
drug gangs in rio de janeiro have more firepower than the police, have successfully attacked police stations and have forced businesses and schools to close.
president luiz inacio lula da silva stated in an interview with a foreign correspondent in 2003 that --
national sovereignty and national security are policy matters.
some pilots of drug-running aircraft feel so confident of their immunity to retribution that they gesture obscenely at brazilian air force pilots in pursuit.
under brazilian law, the constitution is the law. brazil prohibits the death penalty as a punishment for criminal acts.
some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounted to a de facto death sentence for drug traffickers, contrary to the government's claims.
the o estado de sao paolo newspaper in a daily editorial stated that the extreme measure raises problems of ethics and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefit.
people are extrajudicially penalized by application of an administrative decision made by the air force commander.
these people gained power over the lives and deaths of crew members and regular flyers.
brazil inaugurated the 1.4 billion dollar radar system sivam in 2002 which allows the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive amazon region for the first time.
the system uses united states technology.
illegal flights initially declined 30 percent due to traffic concerns about improved tracking, but subsequently reaccelerated.
brazil recorded 4,128 unauthorized flights in 2003.
some of these flights are illegal, including those flown by innocent ranchers flying between plantations in the amazon.
viegas stated that the deliberate violation of brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who apparently realize the government is incapable of retaliation has increased significantly.
fernandinho beira-mar, the most notorious drug boss in rio de janeiro, was captured in colombia in april 2001 in a gun pipeline for drugs involving leftist guerrillas.
the northern amazon corridor of brazil has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
routes of the most important drug and gun smuggling routes for supplying cocaine to europe are reportedly running from colombia to suriname across the northern tier of the amazon basin.
colombia is the only country with a current policy of targeting drug aircraft.
colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the united states.

venezuelan president's deal with russia on weapons, curbs on military cooperation with the united states and plans to train as many as 2 million civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion has worried venezuela and its domestic critics.
venezuelan president hugo chavez's deal with russia over weapons, curbing military cooperation with russia and plans to train as many as 2 million civilians to repel a possible imperialist invasion by the united states and domestic critics of chavez have worried the former military officer leftist.
chavez insisted the move was purely defensive and that it was overdue for venezuela to update its obsolete military hardware and protect itself from any nation that might want to control venezuela.
venezuela is the largest petroleum-producing state in south america.
domestic opponents of chavez scoff at the idea of a us invasion of venezuela, charging that chavez truly intends to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists to protect against any internal rising and to pose a military counterweight to the influence of the us in latin america.
castro is a major ally of chavez and the two have grown closer.
detractors of chavez in the us government say that chavez's strategy of restructuring venezuelan democracy in the image of a militarized style of socialism from cuba, and fomenting a leftist revolution throughout south america, could even more troubled by chavez's purchases of arms and indoctrination of civilian militias.
us strategists say they are increasingly concerned about the potential for such a revolution to be fomented by chavez's radical moves, inspired by chavez.
latin american politics has shifted leftward since the late 1990 s.
this leftward shift is largely a reaction to the perceived failure of free market economics.
leftists elected to lead brazil, argentina, chile, uruguay, ecuador and venezuela.
supporters of chavez at home countered that the united states has a long history of open and covert intervention in the domestic politics of latin america and said that the united states has no right to question venezuela's preparations for defense.
venezuelans never asked what us marines do, " carlos roque espinoza leon " said.
espinoza leon, a chavez supporter, is a specialist in defense in venezuela's national assembly.
espinoza said peru has 500,000 rifles and no one is saying anything.
espinoza said no one complains that colombia is the most militarized country in latin america.
espinoza said the history of the united states is full of aggression in latin america.
espinoza said venezuelans must do whatever is necessary to protect the country.
chavez said in a famous speech that the so-called bolivarian revolution in venezuela was peaceful but armed.
chavez was first elected in 1998 and a datanalisis poll, an independent firm, rated him at 71 percent popularity.
venezuelan military analyst alberto garrido said chavez is looking for allies in russia, china and iran to promote a multi-polar world that would counteract us dominance and encourage grass-roots movements in latin america to throw off government influence.
lorenzo campos, a farmer in the northern venezuelan state of anzoategui, and reservists trained by him.
campos said venezuelans want the world to know they are not prepared to attack anyone and that their mission is to protect the country.
in may 2005 the chavez government announced details of a deal with the russian firm to purchase 100,000 ak-103 assault rifles each with 30 rounds of ammunition for $ 18.6 million and the transfer of technology to venezuela for the manufacture of the rifles.
the deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle.
this price is considerably less than the $ 825 - $ 850 price for the same weapon ordered through the us postal service.
the venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 russian helicopters, 10 spanish transport planes and 6 spanish navy craft.
venezuelan officials said the government had negotiated with brazil to buy around 24 air support and train planes.
chavez insisted and even staunchest critics here, retired military, agreed that the purchase was essential to update old weapons like the fal, decades old from belgium.
retired general fernando ochoa antich said the statement that chavez is engaged in an arms buildup is an exaggeration.
ochoa was defense minister in 1992 during the failed chavez coup.
ochoa stated that venezuela has not purchased arms in the past 25 years and that chavez has not bought weapons aggressively or threateningly towards his neighbors.
ochoa said venezuela has never before bought arms from russia and suggested chavez bought the arms to become independent of the us.
ochoa asked why chavez was buying the popular rifle caliber among subversive forces in latin america and stated that his political support for radical leftist moves made him a continental menace.
the us pentagon has openly questioned what chavez is doing with the old fal rifles and whether he can share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in latin america.
the us government has provided no evidence that chavez is arming or funding a leftist insurgency.
military analysts who analyzed colombian guerrilla of the farc said that the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and are not interested in old rifles from belgium or chavez's assistance.
a study published by the us defense intelligence agency in 2003 reported that more than half of the weapons seized from colombian guerrillas between 1998 and 2001 originated in venezuela.
it implies that corrupt or sympathetic venezuelan military members could aid the guerrillas.
the critic has said that the chavez-opposing military and new civilian reservists are more distressing than the ideological military train that the critic has in mind.
in 2005 chavez called for the so-called revolutionary units to start preparing the public for resistance to the superpower aggressor and said the first step in that resistance would be to train millions of volunteers to back up the country's active duty armed forces in the coming years.
military analysts estimate venezuela's active duty armed forces number 83,000.
the person's defense unit was created in neighborhoods, state companies and the free university, established under chavez, and reports directly to the president.
the government insists that the reserves will support the armed forces and will not act against a possible chavez coup in column 5.
espinoza said reserves should not be used for any shock troops and that each person would decide which side to be on in a civil war.
general julio ramon quintero viloria is the reserve commander.
quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians in the second half of 2005 at a rate of 20 per weekend and that 300,000 more could be trained in 2006.
quintero said venezuelans don't want any empire's colony and are ready for any possibility.
in june 2005, 100,000 reservists and the venezuelan navy engaged in a massive war game to repel an invading country that was stronger.
in june 2005, 40 state oil company employees participated in a similar exercise with 1,200 soldiers.
chavez's circle of supporters here warns of asymmetrical warfare.
asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by us strategic military planners to describe conflicts between unequal combatants in which the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
the us government has given colombia $ 330 million in military aid over the past five years.
chavez loyalists fear that the us government could instigate a proxy war between colombia and venezuela in order to oust chavez and control venezuelan oil.
in interviews, senior us officials dismissed the notion that the us government wants to invade venezuela as completely and utterly nonsensical.
officials said chavez's side wishes to make a negative relationship because they calculate politically that mr. chavez will reach power by constantly confronting the us.
another rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises by chavez is troubling to the united states.
the us military has had a cooperation office at venezuela's fort for 50 years.
in 2004, chavez shut it down.
5 us military trainers and students participating in the exchange program were ordered to leave the country in april 2005.
analysts say chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
analysts say chavez's use of that force to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere is unproven.

the north korean government could be preparing to begin shutting down its plutonium-producing reactor in june 2007 in the first step toward disabling it by december 2007.
foreign assistant secretary christopher hill stated on june 18, 2007 that the north korean government could be prepared to begin shutting down its plutonium-producing reactor in june 2007 as the first step toward disabling it by december 2007.
hill is the head negotiator for the united states in the north korean nuclear weapons program.
hill stated that stalled efforts to dismantle north korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of june 16-17, when international atomic energy agency inspectors are invited by pyongyang officials to talk about verifying and monitoring the shutdown.
hill stated that the shutdown was anticipated to be long following talks with chinese negotiator wu dawei.
hill stated that the shutdown could occur within weeks, but not months.
the iaea reported june 18 in vienna, austria, that the team visited pyongyang the previous week to discuss the manner of inspectors verifying the shutdown.
hill stated that iaea inspectors held talks with pyongyang officials regarding the reactor seals, including the installation of television monitoring equipment at the site.
north korean officials refused to proceed with a february 2007 agreement to begin decommissioning yongbyon until the 25 million dollars in funds held in a macao bank account linked to north korea were transferred.
money was frozen after u.s. officials accused banco delta asia of complicity in north korean financial crimes.
on june 14, 2007 the fund wired the new york federal reserve bank after months of disagreement over the fund's return method.
the fund is supposed to send the funds to the russian central bank before the transfer to the north korean government account at a russian commercial bank.
hill stated that the negotiators from russia, south korea and japan who met in tokyo june 17 th to negotiate disarmament talked about recouping time lost during the transfer of financial resources.
the timetable for resuming six-nation talks on arms control was also discussed.
under an agreement reached in february 2007, north korean officials pledged to shut down yongbyon and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for 50,000 tons of fuel oil shipments.
in the next phase of the agreement, north korean officials declared an all-nuclear program and disabled all facilities in return for 950,000 tons of further fuel oil.
hill stated that a technical conclusion on the next phase of the agreement could be reached by december 2007.

the leader of the leading arms control expert criticized the new nuclear activity plan released by iran and the international atomic energy agency of the u.n. as ineffective and dangerous.
iran and the international atomic energy agency of the u.n. released a plan on august 27, 2007 to resolve the issue by december 2007.
the issue has not been resolved in 4 years.
the plan is meant to allay suspicions about iran's past nuclear activities.
officials stated that the plan was a breakthrough.
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated on 08/28/2007 at a news conference in tehran that --
the investigation into iran's nuclear activities is now closed.
none of the other iaea member countries have cooperated as well as iran has.
iran is a nuclear nation.
iran has a nuclear fuel cycle.
iran will not succumb to international pressure to curb its nuclear projects.
iran's nuclear project is for peaceful purposes.
the united states and some european nations believe iran's nuclear project is aimed at making nuclear weapons.
several western governments and arms control experts stated that iran was attempting to avoid further punishment from the u.n. security council.
the united states and france are among western governments.
the government and experts believe that iran has made an attempt.
the arms control process is slow.
the question of iran's past violations of the treaty is avoided.
david albright, president of the institute for science and international security, stated that --
it is not possible to verify iran's claims.
the international atomic energy agency does not have access to people, documents or sites.
the organization lost the right to further question the iaea in the future.
the usual development sets a bad precedent.
the iaea could be tricked because of its eagerness to make a deal.

it is not clear whether the attack began on 080918 or 080919 morning.
al-sistani's website was offline on 09/19 evening.
another website related to one of al-sistani's religious organizations, www.al-shia.com, was also affected.
the alternative address www.sistani.com is still operational.
iran's fars news agency stated that xp group blocked access to approximately 300 shiite-related sites on september 18 and 19.

somali pirates who hijacked a ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms approached a deal to release the ship.
questions emerge regarding arms shipments through the route to kenya and possibly clandestine arms deals between kenya and south sudan.
maritime officials and associates of the somali pirates who hijacked the ukrainian freighter carrying large amounts of arms on 080925 stated on 081008 that the pirates could collect a ransom for the freighter soon.
after difficult negotiations involving several people involved in haggling in a bazaar style, the party closed to reach a deal that included millions of dollars in pirate payoffs and freeing the ship.
somalia businessman ahmed omar in xarardheere stated pirates had agreed to ransom the ship to the ship owners for approximately 8 million u.s. dollars and the ship could be freed on 081008 or 081009.
xarardheere, a notorious pirate base on the somali coast.
kenyan maritime officials stated that there are yet to be agreements on critical details.
one such detail involves pirate requests for guarantees that the current armada of united states warships currently encircling pirates will not arrest or attack pirates.
kenyan maritime officials stated that such negotiations are complex and involve more than just financial aspects.
officials stated on october 8, 2008 that progress was made and that the parties were approaching agreement.
the pirates initially requested 35 million u.s. dollars and then reduced it to 20 million u.s. dollars.
the pirates consistently express a willingness to negotiate financial figures.
more than 25 ships were hijacked off the somali coast in 2008 to be ransomed for typically between $ 1 and $ 2 million in u.s. dollars.
pirates who boarded a ukrainian ship stated that the ship and its cargo and the 20 sailors on board would be released in exchange for payment of $ 100 us dollars or the pirates preferred $ 100 bills.
the original destination country of the arms shipments that boarded ukrainian ships:
the kenyan government claimed shortly after the hijacking of the freighter on september 25, 2008 that the weapons were being shipped to the kenyan military.
ships via the main kenyan port of mombasa.
the weapons on board included 33 t-72 tanks, 150 anti-tank grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
subsequent evidence emerged of weapons in kenya's clandestine arms deal with the southern sudanese separatists.
if the pirates had not hijacked the ship and had not begun speaking to the media via satellite phone, the deal was most likely to remain secret.
ukrainian officials are adamant that there was no wrongdoing.
oleh belokolos, a ukrainian diplomat in kenya, stated that --
ukraine has no supplies of any armaments to the government of south sudan and has no plans to do so.
all appropriate paperwork has been validated.
ukraine will abide by all united nations rules and agreements on arms control.
ukraine inherited an enormous stockpile of weaponry after the soviet union collapsed and now has major arms deals.
the deal with ukraine is considered suspicious because kenya relies mostly on the united kingdom and other western countries for heavy weapons supplies.
several commissions have been called upon by kenyan politicians to answer questions and examine the situation.
southern sudan, currently increasing its military and using soviet-designed tanks, is a region of autonomy.
the united states military stated that it would prioritize ensuring that the ship did not unload weapons and that the weapons were not sold to islamist insurgents in somalia.
pirates denied any interest in the weapons and claimed they were unaware that tanks were part of the cargo when they hijacked the ship.
last week, pirate spokesman sugule ali stated in an interview that the pirates' sole interest in the deal was money.

u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said that afghanistan produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium to support the price and preserve a major source of insurgency financing.
u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said that afghanistan produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium to support the price and preserve the major source of insurgency financing.
costa told reporters last week as the u.n. drug office prepared to release its latest survey of afghanistan's opium crop.
the survey showed that poppy cultivation has retreated much in afghanistan and is overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of the 34 provinces, mostly in the southern provinces, where the insurgency remains strong.
the survey was issued on 27 november 2008.
the united nations found that despite a 6 percent drop in total opium production, the amount of land devoted to opium in afghanistan was reduced by 19 percent.
the study attributes high output to one acre to a good growing season in the south.
heavy irrigation area in the south where the taliban maintain a strong presence in five provinces and systematically encourage opium cultivation to finance their insurgency for several years.
the u.n. estimated that insurgents made much more than 300 million dollars from the opium trade last year.
costa said a lot of the war effort could be funded between 20 million and 300 million dollars.
the taliban produced an amount of opium far in excess of world demand for three successive bumper crops.
costa said the result would be a glut that would depress prices that have dropped by about 20 percent.
costa said the collapse of the price already was evidence that the taliban, drug lords and some farmers were stockpiling opium.
in afghanistan, the amount of opium processed also increased.
costa added that insurgents were holding a significant amount of opium.
costa said the surplus was as much as 11,000 tons (18,000 tons), or more than twice the world's demand three years ago, and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
the united nations found that afghanistan produced 8,500 tons of opium in 2008.
world demand is estimated at about 4400 tons per year.
the taliban stood passively by this year as the opium crop was cultivated and less pressure was put on afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
then this supports the current price.

hong kong police are trying to prevent triads and transnational criminal syndicates from engaging in criminal activities.
hong kong police have recently smashed a transnational theft syndicate specializing in exploiting youngsters to commit various crimes, a cross-boundary criminal syndicate specializing in theft, and a local triad gang specializing in theft.
the effort by the hong kong police to cut down five people, including so-called leaders of triad branches and those called " district team leaders ", within three weeks after the event is determined to be a demonstration of the police's determination to eradicate criminal activities, opined the oriental daily news.
hong kong police recently worked closely with the guangdong public security bureau to exchange intelligence and carried out a series of raids and operations.
hong kong police cracked down on triad activities including drug trafficking, illegal possession of arms, stealing, burglary, robbery, selling pirated and obscene records, and trafficking in dangerous drugs from 020718 to 020724.
a police report stated that over 100 staff were dispatched on july 24, 2002 to storm a propitiatory dance and wine party organized to settle some disputes between two triad groups at a disco nightclub in mongkok, kowloon.
in the end, three branch leaders and 14 core triad members were arrested.
police sources confirmed to xinhua news agency that all 17 arrested persons are still under questioning as of july 25, 2002.
according to hong kong police sources, the operation has netted all 17 people, resulting from police efforts to infiltrate relevant gangs here.
police sources also intimated that the crackdown on other triad gangs would also follow.
hong kong police cooperated with police in mainland china and other regions in their activities in fighting off organized criminal groups.
the first so-called target conference of the international drug enforcement conference in the far east was held in hong kong in july 2002.
hong kong was chosen to host the event following a decision made at the idec meeting held in bolivia in february 2002.
42 senior officers from mainland china, hong kong, australia, indonesia, japan, south korea, myanmar, the philippines, singapore, thailand and the united states met.
a recent internal news letter of the hong kong police reported that the aim of the conference is to provide a flexible forward-thinking environment for information sharing and positive action to counter organized transnational drug traffickers.
intelligence exchanges between hong kong police and police on the mainland of china are particularly intense.
a delegation of 11 members from the national narcotics control commission of the mainland of china visited hong kong recently to study how the police here enforce their anti-narcotics laws.
the team of 11 people was chaired by chen cunyi, deputy director of the bureau of narcotics control of the ministry of public security of the chinese government, and briefed by hong kong police on enforcement actions carried out in hong kong, ip lau chuen, head of the hong kong narcotics bureau led the team.
hong kong police also exchanged mutual concerns with the chinese national narcotics control commission and discussed a number of issues, including investigations into drug trafficking and money laundering activities.
the mainland party closed their visit after meeting with hong kong deputy assistant commissioner of crimes yam tat wing and discussed further proposals for cooperation in combating cross-boundary drug trafficking activities.

france's foreign minister characterized the recent raid on the paris office of the people's mujahedeen as part of the fight against terrorism.
french foreign minister dominique de villepin said on june 3, 2003 that the french government considers the crackdown on the iranian armed opposition group the people's mujahedeen to be part of anti-terrorism operations.
french radio france info de villepin said the people's mujahedeen claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in iran and that the dimensions of terrorism could not be hidden.
de villepin said the justice system would decide the arrest and that there was no diplomatic factor in this affair.
de villepin said the french action was based on strict justice and would determine all fights against terrorism.
french police raided the headquarters of the people's mujahedeen organization in the northwest of paris on 22 june 2003.
the people's mujahedeen accused the french authorities of having a part in the deal with the iranian government to carry out operations.
the iranian government has denied these claims.
the judiciary is now investigating 17 members of the mujahedeen organization for alleged links to terrorist organizations and funding terrorist activities.
some 160 people were initially detained in the initial police crackdown on over 10 people's mujahedeen locations in france.
during the police raid, paris maps with outlined streets related to the us embassy, bulletproof jackets, transmitting equipment, more than 200 computers and about 9 million dollars in cash were seized.
the united states, the european union and iran classified the people's mujahedeen as a terrorist organization.
the people's mujahedeen was formed in the 1960 s by young iranian college students and is described as a left-wing islamist organization.
the people's mujahedeen staged terrorist attacks inside iran in the 1970 s and killed several us military personnel and civilians working on defense projects in teheran.
the broad coalition that initially supported the iranian revolution and participated in the 1979 takeover of the us embassy in teheran included the people's mujahedeen.
the people's mujahedeen and the government have fallen out and since the 1980 s have built military bases in iraq and political bases in europe.
the people's mujahedeen claimed responsibility for several assassinations of iranian regime officials in recent years.
this assassination is one of these assassinations which include the assassination of assodalah ladjevardi, the former director of teheran's evin prison in august 1998 and the assassination of ali sayad chirazi, a former iranian army chief commander and general in april 1999.
