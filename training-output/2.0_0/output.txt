Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Wednesday that Iran would pursue its nuclear program and resume negotiations with the West after it had resisted Western demands that it halt its nuclear activities.
Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy chief, recently offered Iran two proposals.
The United States has endorsed a package that consists of incentivizing the cessation of uranium enrichment and the production of uranium enrichment.
Iran will not negotiate with the West on its nuclear program before it has frozen its uranium enrichment program for six weeks.

campos, venezuelan, wants to know the world, and is not prepared to attack anyone, but to protect venezuela's mission.
The government of Venezuela announced that it had signed a deal with Russia to purchase 100,000 AK-103 rifles, 30,000 rounds of ammunition for each rifle, and 186 million dollars in technology transfer. The deal was signed in 2005.
The deal is for a rate of $186.22 per rifle.
The cost of this weapon is less than $825, but more than $850.
The Venezuelan government intends to buy 10 Russian helicopters, 10 Spanish planes, and 6 Venezuelan navy craft.
Venezuela's government officials are negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 planes and trains to support air and train operations.

The United States government gave $330 million in military aid to Colombia over the past five years.
"Chavez fears that the US government might instigate a war between Colombia and Venezuela, which would oust him and control the oil."
The United States dismissed the notion that it wanted to invade Venezuela, as utterly complete, in an interview with a senior official.
Mr. Chavez wishes the US would stop confronting him constantly in politics.
another trouble for the united states as chavez rolls back cooperation with the military and exercises joint military with venezuela.
The United States military has a cooperation office in Venezuela that has been there for 50 years.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has said that Afghanistan is producing much opium in recent years, so much so that criminal organizations have stockpiled raw opium to support their insurgency and preserve their major source of finance.
The head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said that Afghanistan is producing much opium recently, and that the Taliban have cut back on cultivating poppy and stockpiling raw opium, and that the Taliban are using opium to support their insurgency and to preserve their major source of financing.
This is the report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) on the opium poppy crop in Afghanistan, which was released last week.
The survey shows that the insurgency has retreated from cultivating poppy in Afghanistan, but has concentrated on cultivating poppy in 7 of the 34 provinces where the insurgency is strongest.
On November 27, 2008, the survey was issued.
The United Nations has reduced the amount of opium produced in Afghanistan by 19 percent, just six percent of the total tonnage.

Most people feel awkward getting a university degree alone. I recommend that you get an appointment with a counselor at the university. It's really important to tell anyone or depress you. You don't have to tell anyone or depress you. You have some obvious problems in a minute. It's possible to use some support. It's important to compare to the thing you experience. It's helpful to meditate and exercise. It's really helpful to try to do and meditate and exercise. It's obligate to engage and help the general life. It's beat-up you. It's kind of hope to pass the feeling of this. It's kind of you to get help.

The Virginia State Route 288 (SR 288) is a 12.2-mile (19.6 km) state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. It is located in the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area. The route runs in a circumference around the southwest quadrant of Richmond. The highway was built in the late 2004.
Already, the pattern of development is causing congestion around the exits, localizing traffic.
The Richmond Times-Dispatch tells the tale of the impact of the Huguenot Trail in Powhatan County today.
The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) is reporting that a double fatality crash occurred on Huguenot Trail in the 288 section of the roadway. The crash occurred more than 12 hours after the roadway opened.
as well as the surge in accidents, there has been a surge in speeding.
so far this year, there have been 17 accidents near the intersection of winterfield road.
Dale Totten, an engineer who resides in Virginia, said that the Virginia Department of Transportation has four lanes of government-organization road in good condition, and that the cost of the government-organization road is about $13 million.
Of course the government is going to spend money to construct a road in Richmond.
"The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) spent $1.5 million on the 288 project, which was boosted by local politicians."
Homer Simpson is located at amr-unknown at the time you need him.
This is the first moment of the major expressive doh.
We predict that the development of the area around the exit of Route 288 will overtax the local country roads.
The contrast between the location of work and the location of home is possible to relieve traffic on the highway between the counties of Chesterfield and Goochland.
and they created the traffic congestion in the new place.
"I was surprised at the rapid manner in which this only happened."
"I think that it is possible that the lag between the 3-year and 4-year temporal quantities is 3 years."
You are liable to create a road that exits all roads, and cause the creation of a road that costs $13000000 to construct, just in time for exit 1.

well before the end of the decade, we saw liability of the fund of the original highway builders zoom to 400 million dollars.
"The idea of a brainiac thinking that such a great road name is 288 is."
Thank you for nothing.
I think we could spend the $400 million more wisely.
I think you shouldn't blame me for the road 288 (name 288) that was created by that person.
They are creating new places to congest traffic.

Q: What is the congestion on the old road? 
A: Additional traffic congestion on the old road.
now you feel like a person named tmt who lives in fairfax, virginia

The contrast between the excessive need for other roads and the glaring need for 288 is definite.

this audit report found that the state transportation board and the virginia department of transportation had funded a transportation project that was based on the good lobbying of most of the project's base instead of the comprehensive transportation plan.

"I need support for my business. I'm overwhelmed with work and of course I have to go to my grandmother's on Sunday to watch my son's soccer game."
we suffer from congestion problems caused by the fact that we have not been able to match the expenditure of roads with the increase in domestic business product.
