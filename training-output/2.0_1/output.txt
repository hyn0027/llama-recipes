support the person who started the thread resolutely, i will reply with a poem.
pledge to fight to the death to defend the diaoyu islands and related islands.
the fishing fleet was bumped, the little japanese ghosts stirred up trouble and unrest, and showed their wolfish appearance again with the heart of a thief and the arrogance of a form.
go back in time to that time when we appeared to be humiliated when we signed the treaty, never go back to that time, china is strong, sharp the sword, shine the knife, bury the approaching enemy.
2010-09-11
i agree with the analysis of the person who started the thread. if there really is a war, i like hua mulan to protect our home and defend our homeland, to spread the prestige of our china, and to pledge to fight to the death to defend our national dignity.
i wish i could bear that passionate upsurge long march of mao zedong to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all the enemies of china who are wrong and have been the enemies of china, and spread our dragon's prestige.
how long will we tolerate japan?
i say to my fellow citizens.
hello everyone, i have been saying for a long time that japan has been planning another incident at sea, like the lugou bridge incident, which is similar to the september 18th incident, we all know about.
japan has surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world and has openly invaded our sacred territory, the diaoyu islands.
the diaoyu islands have always belonged to china, we all know that, but because of historical reasons, what belongs to us originally has become controversial.
fellow citizens, i say we are what we are and why negotiations are needed. japan has gone even further, which means they want to create the fact of occupation. can we allow this? absolutely not.
i say to my fellow citizens, the militarism of japan has brought grave disaster to asians.
china suffered japan's ravages for several decades.
the japanese unit 731 military experimented on chinese, korean and other people with extremely brutal methods on human bodies in northeast china, adding a layer of blood that will never fade away in ancient capital nanjing, the big and bloody battles in hengyang and changsha bare the bones of the dead over hundreds of kilometers, everything was killed off in the battles.
i have said to my fellow citizens too many instances of heinous crimes committed by japan in china that are difficult to record, not to exhaust all the bamboo strips.
just like those deceased millions of souls that lost their lives, wandering over the pacific ocean, and finding it difficult to rest in peace.
still, all those who experienced that era will remember it vividly, and even our younger generation will cry tears down our cheeks and boil with indignation at any time we turn to this page of history and read it.
japan's actual wanting now to reverse the verdict on its history of aggression is what is waking up fellow citizens and chinese in asia.
we have to go forward, although it is painful to look back at this 100 years of shame, but we have to create history and choose history, even if the historical issues are not resolved.
we are not afraid because the territory is small and related to matters of dignity. the honor is guaranteed by the interests of the country and the nation's unity regardless of how the wind and clouds change. we cannot let our native land be separated although it is scarred with wounds.
fellow citizens, i say to you that the 21 st century advent means that china is facing many challenges, and that we are in a time when we are beset from within and pressured from without.
we should go the way of issuing taiwan, tibet, south china sea, surrounding environment and foreign forces aggressive to china.
i say fellow citizens, look at the world map, look at the crescent encirclement, suppressing our breath, strangling our development, coveting our national territory.
we never feared the people, we never wanted to make our enemies, we never feared war, we never wanted war.
we must urgently arrange our armed forces and strengthen all our military forces on land, sea and air.
before several thousand years of chinese nation's flourishing, the nation never had the ambition of expanding its territory outward.
we do not impose on others what we do not want, so we follow a strategic foreign security philosophy of benevolence and virtue.
the tolerance and liberalness of the country is like the tolerance and liberalness of the individual, which means we have to insist that we not hurt ourselves but avoid hurting other people.
tolerance is not certain fear, cowardice is not sincerity.
china's exemption of japan from war repair caused by world war ii serves the peace of benevolence.
i say to my fellow citizens, the people's heroes monument is a condensed history of china's nation that is striving for continued improvement.
the solemn and magnificent posture represents the sacred expectations of peace.
my memory string is occasionally agitated by the many heroic and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses that spring up in my mind.
i went to that yellow history page and saw that kangxi emperor who contemplated how he achieved the unification of the territory alone in his audience hall a hundred years ago and also abraham lincoln who wandered the dark halls of the great hall alone and thought about the integrity of the union.
peaceful world is dangerous to forget the war, i say we must never exercise forbearance blindly, we want development and peace, the boxer protocol is a betrayal and humiliation of the nation, china is poor and backward in modern times, the fall behind is the bully.
if not for peace, what would come of it?
we must focus on educating the defense of the nation, build up the great wall in the heart of 1.3 billion people, and establish a full-range, capable defense system to defend the nation.
(snt1) the best defense is to strengthen our force engaging in the long-range attack we can possibly engage in, and to improve our deep and great combat capabilities in all aerospace; (snt2) you must increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate modernization and internationalization of military equipment, and establish high-quality elite high-tech divisions as a premise to avoid the influence of economic development of the nation; (snt3) the best defense is to strengthen our force engaging in the long-range attack we can possibly engage in, and to improve our deep and great combat capabilities in all aerospace.
the battle horns are about to sound, people are already fully equipped and ready to go.
without the support of people, we accomplished nothing, but with their support, we are all powerful.
i said to my fellow citizens, time for us to achieve.
the guarantee fund was established, work environment and work mechanism were improved, and hundreds of thousands of information technology professionals who had emigrated to the united states and around the world were recruited back to china.
2. a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were created.
manufacture 5,000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds.
4. research and deployment of high speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles, which could break missile defense systems.
5. nuclear experiments resumed and military forces established in space.
6 th, retain 1000 nuclear bombs equal to 1 million tons of trinitrotoluene and install nuclear warheads on all short and medium range missiles when needed.
li 7. retain 30 nuclear-powered strategic submarines capable of inflicting 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
you have abandoned your commitment to not first use nuclear weapons.
9. retain the right to preemptive strike when national security is threatened.
fellow citizens, qin shi huang unified china, zheng chenggong recovered taiwan, we must carry on the far-sightedness, insight and strong will of our predecessors in responsibility.
fellow citizens, now that piece of land that has been trembling far from the embrace of motherland is shaking and moaning and calling out, let us carry forward what the previous generations wished for but could not fulfill, let us move forward courageously.
reading history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmered into my nation's concern. i will serve our motherland as a volunteer to make her prosper and be splendid once again. i am willing to bear the cloth gown and be included in the common people. my sincere and patriotic heart is adequate to show heaven.
i have composed this poem here in the classical form of ci, to voice the aspirations of my heart.
paint your lips a deep red.
protect the diaoyu islands.
we lost our ryukyu islands bitterly.
how can we allow diaoyu islands to fall into other countries?
100 years of vicissitude.
the smoke and cloud chased the flying wave.
his youngest brother was still a tender youth.
all directions wandered and the seal bore.
flagged.
we brandished our weapons and crossed east.
let the horse drink from the pacific ocean.

so why are we not fighting little japan?
how do chinese people tolerate this?
they rode our heads even.
do the chinese still have the guts to do this?
we should tell the whole world that china cannot bully other countries at will.
it's time we showed our strength, china has been too calm for too long.
all our citizens' lives are too carefree currently, officials are too extravagant.
we don't have cohesion now already, china needs to start a war, the face of the countries following the us rear has been slapped harshly.
let them know that the us is not a panacea, if we win, the influence of china can be increased, and the cohesion of the citizens can be improved, if we lose, we can clean out the incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out, let china have new blood and update.
go china!
i suggest that china strengthen the guard of the diaoyu islands, and guard them every day, and protect the fishermen and our sovereignty. if japan dares to invade our territory by military force, we will fight a small scale war by defending ourselves regardless of the cost. china cannot lose.
we need to show it in life, but really, when you show someone you're embracing them, that's really what it's about.
i just passed by.
this is like the whole society, including the stars.
damn, not sexy.
it is not totally acceptable.
just a cheap entertainer, they have somewhat of a reputation in feudal china.
they lived gloriously.
the group consists of nine professionals.
hard life
shock
that's normal, and whores are always heartless and the performers are never righteous.
they want money, not face.
look at the wolf near ms. fan with glasses, you know the actor has to drink with him or he will be forced out or even not even framed.
son of a bitch
ok as long as something lovely to eat.
no one is easy, it's like a show, you have to look at the script to know how to perform.
somebody all.
the top imperial examination scorer in life, all 360 steps, how much effort and endeavor behind him, this is a humiliation to the words " vermicelli beans ".
:lol:
overdo
reality
shoot that hooligan.
cheap performers.
cheap performers.
the entertainment circle is dirty, all the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
that star female is not easy, pity them, but who is to blame?
everybody does this, you can make money in any way if you don't do this.
women take pride in being in front of others, but when they are alone, they are melancholy.
just like the stars nowadays, they were just popular prostitutes in ancient times. nowadays, they are famous prostitutes, so it's just normal for them to drink and sleep with some high officials.
stop talking to other people, just behave.
we recommend that you do in the future, it is not alone capable of success, we also face such hard choices?
the suffering is more disguised than it looks, there is no dispute about that.
it's not so bad because they're just playing in their own circle, out of sight and out of mind.
but there's an old guy named zhang jizhong who behaves like a hooligan in his circle and thinks he's virtuous because he's not talented, he made a tv series when he had nothing to do, to wreck the whole country.
both took what they needed.
when will china have a pure and innocent girl?
now the story is very shocking in the entertainment world, rumors are that hsu yuki was forced out because he refused to drink with the arranged company guests and was instead obligated to switch to working as a lawyer's assistant to make the end meet.
superstars often encounter social encounters or circumstances that they are not welcome to but are obligated to join in.
the reason they cann't decide on many things after all is because decisions have to do with many aspects and the interests of many people.
sometimes, a star's dinner party isn't as simple as it seems to us ordinary people, that is, not as simple as we imagine it to be.
the stars have a lot of contracts and if they tackle well their sources of money will roll in, if she doesn't tackle well then she will come out of the heels or even be framed.
two star smart female kind: that person always holds very high integrity and sternly rejects all such invitations.
the second kind of person is good at playing tricks and achieving his objectives with his own seed money.
even some superstar female will win this way.
after some drinks, the advertiser or sponsor of the show may have a chance to lie on the star's shoulder, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek. the star is most likely to adopt an enduring attitude.
they are very low-paid professionals.
those stars are just pretending, and actually living a much better life than this.
just a cheap entertainer, they have somewhat of a reputation in feudal china.
i agree.
oh well, not easy for the actors.
they deserve it, they asked for it.
nothing is easy for me.
women are birds and beasts, and men are more bird and beast than women.

international; weapons; politics; proliferation; energy
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) has reached agreement with iranian officials that there are no remaining issues or ambiguities regarding iran's nuclear program and activities.
u.s. and european officials suspect the iranian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials suspect that the iranian nuclear civilian energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials could impose the 4 th round of sanctions on tehran by the time the u.n. security council is likely to consider the issue of iran's nuclear program in september 2007.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) distributed limited copies of publications that are copies of iaea reports before the 35 members of the iaea board met on 11 september 2007.
the findings reflect the agreement reached between tehran and the iranian officials on 21 august 2007, which was publicized by iranian officials beginning 12 august 2007.
the accord says that the issue of iran's nuclear program and activities will remain unresolved and ambiguous with regard to iran's nuclear program and activities.
a reuters news agency account said the iaea report said the plan of work was a significant step forward.
a senior u.n. official was quoted by reuters as saying that iran's efforts to enrich uranium were " slow ".
the iaea report stated that iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of the country's present and future nuclear programs.
iranian officials stated on august 30, 2007 that iranian officials were cooperating with the iaea to prevent further rounds of international sanctions.
iran's representative to the iaea, ali asghar soltanieh, told fars news agency in tehran that the report emphasizes that there is no sign or evidence indicating diversion of iran's nuclear activities and that all of iran's nuclear material has been audited.
some non-proliferation experts stated that the iaea has ceded too much to iran.
the 20070819 published criticism states that the idea of closing the files violates fundamental safeguards and that the agreement does not specify that iranian officials will provide the iaea with access to key people and facilities and necessary documents.
independent experts said that iran's agreement with the iaea to allow inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information was the latest sign that iran was responding to western demands to halt production of highly enriched uranium which could be used in a nuclear bomb.
u.s. state department spokesman tom casey stated that while iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program, the report may offer some new details or insights into the development of the program.
casey stated that the nuclear program was moving forward and showed that the iranian regime was continuing to defy the international community.
most western non-proliferation experts said the agreement contained little that would dissuade policy-makers in washington, london, paris and berlin from moving forward another round of security council sanctions.
experts stated that the issue of transparency had been resolved in the previous reports agreed on 21 august 2007.
arms control association director daryl g. kimball stated that the agreement addresses the problem of iran's pursuit of enrichment technology and capabilities which could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material.
kimball stated that the iranian government is designing to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim progress.
iranian officials stated that more sanctions could reduce the possibility of cooperation between inspectors and officials.
the security council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on iran, but the penalties demanded by the u.s. were limited because of pressure from china and russia.
iranian state television quoted iranian ambassador to the united nations soltanieh as saying that the report and the measures make any other unrelated international organization's intervention unjustified and unwarranted.

and proliferation; technology; international; politics.
the israeli proposal to allow international nuclear technology transfers to non-proliferation rule signatories was distributed to the nuclear suppliers group.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win india an exemption from nuclear trade sanctions.
israeli officials have convinced the key nuclear trading group of nations to adopt new guidelines that would allow international transfers of nuclear technology to non-proliferation rule signatories.
countries not party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, including india, israel and pakistan, will be prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade, including purchases of reactors, uranium fuel or yellowcake.
in march 2007, 45 members of the nuclear suppliers group were distributed a document outlining israel's proposals.
the israeli presentation was not on a paper that allowed for an official denial.
the chairman of the nsg said in a letter that israel's presentation was offered in the context of the nsg's debate on the indian bid for exemption on march 17, 2007.
only india and israel, which are not signatories to the treaty, qualify to be admitted to the nsg.
israel's plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-treaty states in nuclear technology.
one criterion indicates israel's status as a nuclear weapons state, and says that israel should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if it applies stringent physical protection, control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons, facilities and source materials in its territory, and to all special nuclear materials in its territory.
the document circulated in the capitol hill in september 2007 as the bush administration was working toward an agreement with indian officials.
arms control association director daryl kimball stated that the israeli document could affect the debate in india.
kimball stated --
at the nsg, officials from the largest and most powerful countries, india and the united states, were not wanting any obstacles to be placed in the way of india and the united states.
reaching a consensus on india at the nsg meeting in november 2007 was difficult.
israeli proposals gave some officials reasons to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
israel's record is better than india's under international nuclear rules.
the bush administration has rejected israel's proposal, despite the close ties between the israeli and u.s. governments.
the proposal could complicate bush administration efforts to win india an exemption from nuclear trade sanctions.
president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice view the pact as an important part of the administration's foreign policy legacy.
the deal has been controversial in india and must be approved by congress.
with the delay in the election year, the negative legacy of foreign policy of the administration will be affected negatively.
state department spokesman tom casey said the u.s. government views the india deal as unique and does not see it as a precedent for any other country, including israel.
israeli embassy spokesman david siegel said the suggestion that the israeli government demand exemption or link the effort to any other issue, including the india debate, was grossly inaccurate.
seigel stated that--
the israeli government has never asked the nsg for an exemption from the nsgs guidelines on nuclear supplies and has never made a specific request for israel.
israel has fully recognized and adhered to the ngos guidelines.
the israeli government urged the nsg to consider adopting a generic, tiered, multiple-criteria approach to the transfer of nuclear technology.
some nsg officials have previously suggested an approach similar to israel's plan.
the non-nuclear proliferation regime would be considerably enhanced if the ngsl guidelines were modified in line with the proposals of israeli officials.

international; proliferation
ahmadinejad announced that iran's capabilities to produce uranium have been expanded.
iran has refused to commit to a halt in expansion, but has hinted that a halt in the future is possible.
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashhad on july 26, 2008 that iran has expanded its arsenal of centrifuges to over 5,000.
ahmadinejad stated that the first expansion since the april 2008 announcement that iran was approaching implementation of 6000 centrifuges.
iran has articulated a goal of 50,000 centrifuges operating at enrichment plants near natanz.
international communities demand that iran halt nuclear material production.
the media reports differ from the number of centrifuges cited by ahmadinejad.
iranian news agencies reported that ahmadinejad stated that iran has 6,000 working centrifuges, but subsequently removed the statement from the internet.
iranian news agencies have quoted ahmadinejad as referring to " hundreds of thousands " of centrifuges.
experts discount the significance of ahmadinejad's claims because there is no information on the functionality of the centrifuges.
western diplomats in tehran, speaking anonymously, said the number of centrifuges was less important than whether the machines operated and were efficient, but that ahmadinejad's assertions were hindering the resolution of the diplomatic standoff between iran and the west.
new america foundation arms control expert jeffrey g. lewis stated that the think tank realized that iran's goal was to assemble 6,000 centrifuges, but did not know the status of the machines' operational status.
diplomats and arms control experts said technical problems have hindered iran's enrichment program.
iran has repeated its assertion that its nuclear program is aimed only at producing electricity because it contradicts islamic principles.
the us, israel, europe and the majority of western arms control experts believe that iran is pursuing the capability to produce a bomb immediately if it decides to do so.
experts state that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple.
ahmadinejad said the west is still pursuing the resumption of negotiations after iran resisted western demands for iran to halt its nuclear activities.
the eu's foreign policy chief, javier solana, recently presented the two offers to iran.
the package consists of incentives to cease production of enriched uranium, endorsed by the us.
for six weeks, iran was not adding centrifuges and the west refrained from promoting a fourth round of economic sanctions against iran at the un security council.
us officials have repeated that negotiations cannot begin before iran halts all enrichment activities that can be verified, but the bush administration has recently agreed to a proposed freeze and dispatched burns to geneva.
iran refused to respond to the offer made by solana on 26 july 2008 during talks in geneva attended by us undersecretary of state for foreign affairs william j. burns.
the talks constituted the highest level of diplomatic contact between the us and iran in nearly 30 years.
before initiating new sanctions that included a prohibition on selling iran vital refined petroleum products, solana, burns and the european envoy set a deadline for a positive iranian response.
iranian officials refuse to commit to stopping the expansion or observing deadlines.
ahmadinejad appeared on 26 july 2008 to suggest that iran could potentially halt the expansion of centrifuges over a six-week period.
ahmadinejad stated that the west consented to the existence and operation of between 5000 and 6000 centrifuges if the number of centrifuges did not increase.
if the material is highly enriched, 5000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear material to make a power plant or an atomic bomb.
6000 centrifuges running continuously could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for one bomb in six months.
in 20080500 the international atomic energy agency stated that iran possessed 3500 operational centrifuges.

the paris meeting concluded that further diplomatic pressure on iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility would not be agreed.
20081114 a diplomat stated to media on 081113 that at the meeting in paris on 081113 no united states, european, russian or chinese official had reached agreement to take further action to persuade iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility.
the highly technical process of uranium enrichment is capable of producing fuel for nuclear power plants and fissile material for atomic weapons.
the meeting on november 13, 2008 will end with no new measures or announcements.
the french foreign ministry released a statement after the 13 november 2008 meeting stating that the international community has reaffirmed the importance of the dual-track approach to engaging iran diplomatically and working towards sanctions.
russia and china resisted new sanctions against iran.
russia and china are closely tied to iran politically and economically and do not feel domestic pressure to act against iran.
the united states is closely tied to iran in politics and business and iran feels domestic pressure to act against the united states.
russia and china hold veto power over security council decisions.
russian diplomat sergei ryabkov was quoted by interfax news agency in moscow as saying that at the meeting on november 13, 2008 russia will not strike a deal on iranian sanctions and that western countries are in favor of sanctions while china and other countries are not.
ryabkov attended the meeting on 13 november 2008.
a week ago, iranian officials released a report stating that progress has been made on iran's heavy water reactor near arak.
eventually, the iranian heavy water reactor for research near the city of arak may be able to produce plutonium that could be used for nuclear weapons.
satellite images published by the institute for science and international security showed significant progress in the construction of the heavy water research reactor near arak between february 2008 and october 2008.
david albright stated that the heavy water reactor near the iranian city of arak has evaded international security community notices.
david albright said the satellite images said the progress of iran's heavy water research reactor near arak was significant and that the reactor was about 1.5 years into a building frame and was a large finished facility.
david albright, a former arms inspector and director of the washington, d.c.-based institute for science and international security,
iran has stated that it is pursuing nuclear technology for energy production and research.
the united states and its western allies suspect that iran's nuclear production effort preceded the creation of nuclear weapons infrastructure.
under international arms control regulations, the production of low-grade uranium is legal.
the technical and diplomatic challenge facing the incoming barack obama's foreign policy team is to take on the task of stopping iran from mastering the technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
in the last month, the bush administration has been managing to synchronize u.s. policy with the european union, britain, france and germany in order to press for tougher sanctions against iran and diplomatic action.
the international atomic energy agency is expected to release a report next week criticizing iran.
the international atomic energy agency is a nuclear watchdog within the united nations.
the lack of new initiatives on iran's nuclear program at paris talks on 13 november 2008 decreased hopes for another set of un security council sanctions to be imposed before the end of president bush's term.
iran continues to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology while maneuvering diplomatically.
some israeli officials expressed alarm at iran's test of a solid-fuel second-stage rocket this week.
tel aviv is less than 650 miles from iranian territory.

the russian high-security laboratory complex that stores anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria faced electricity losses because it had not paid its electricity bills to mosenergo.
the large repository of anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria, stored in a highly secure russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of moscow, would be threatened by loss of electricity.
recently, officials from the moscow region's electricity utility mosenergo arrived at a russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity due to lack of payment.
the complex is a campus of 90 buildings and served as the location of a secret biological weapons program during the soviet era.
the headline in the izvestia newspaper is incorrect, the virus is not a threat to the city of moscow.
the virus is not at the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
every kind of bacterium that was being studied for use in the soviet union's secret biological weapons program was located at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the virus repository is located in the siberian region of russia.
russian and western officials stated that the cutoff of power at the state scientific center of applied microbiology was unlikely to pose any threat to public health.
russian and western officials stated that there was not enough certainty to be able to know why the power was lost at the state scientific center of applied microbiology, and that it was therefore not possible to know why the public health threat occurred.
general nikolai urakov stated by telephone that the state scientific center of applied microbiology has a quite reliable system of protection in case of emergency.
longtime director of the state scientific center of applied microbiology, general nikolai urakov.
the state scientific and applied microbiology center is working with western scientists to convert the site into a biomedicine manufacturing site.
nikolai urakov, a general, said in a telephone interview that the researchers at the state scientific center of applied microbiology were scared by this threat of sudden electricity shutdowns, which he said was kind of a psychological pressure.
general nikolai urakov stated by telephone that scientists would have to destroy all ongoing bacteriology experiments if power was shut down at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
like the united states and western countries that have contributed about 60 million dollars to transform the former bioweapons complex, another 5 million dollars a year will be paid to the state scientific center of applied microbiology for electric bills and arrears.
american scientists working at the closely-linked state scientific center of applied microbiology stated that the russian government is responsible for paying the research institute's electricity bills.
the peak of western aid to convert one of nikolai urakov's bioweapons laboratories occurred in 1997, when iran offered to purchase research experts from the state scientific and applied microbiology center.
the crisis is being orchestrated by russian scientists and military leaders who depend on western financing to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
american scientist randall lee beatty is working to convert the obolensk state scientific center of applied microbiology into a biotechnology research institute.
beatty stated that this crisis is threatening to cut electricity at the state scientific and applied microbiology center.
randall lee beatty is the director of the international science and technology center.
the international science and technology center (istc) has financed approximately half of the monetary quantity in its budget to support about 350 russian biowarfare scientists and technicians, according to general nikolai urakov.
randall lee beatty stated that the ssacm did not pay its electricity bill for 14 months.
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific and applied microbiology center is one of the most important locations in the world for archiving dangerous pathogens and that it is a shame that it was destroyed because of lack of electricity payments.
approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the state scientific center of applied microbiology and many others are stored in cryogenic casks isolated from the environment by layers of enclosures and oversized air-handling systems all dependent on electricity for function.
the greatest danger is from the shutdown of the electric power at the state scientific and applied microbiology center, as the live germs preserved in the current frozen state will be defrosted.
raymond zilinskas, a biological warfare expert at the monterey institute of international studies, said the main threat is that the research power of the state scientific center of applied microbiology has been cut instead of the threat of the possibility of the escape of the organism.
raymond zilinskas stated that if the worst case scenario happened, the bacteria would be defrosted at -70 degrees and the clean up afterwards would be a real mess because it is not certain that all the bacteria would die.
another example is the electricity utility mosenergo confronting the obolensk state scientific center of applied microbiology, which illustrates the danger of clashing between the basic capitalist imperative of enterprise sustainability and the old soviet weapons science which remains.
the power cuts at the russian nuclear missile bases were caused by overdue power bills in 2000.
the missile silos lost power.
the troops marched to the substation and turned the power back on.
united energy systems, a national company, cut power at a number of military installations around russia in january and february 2001.
the kamchatka center that monitors the russian space forces includes installations that have lost power.
in most cases where military installations cut off electricity, electricity will be restored quickly.
investigations have shown that the utility and military war tug has often forced the military to spend budget funds on electricity power instead of diverting the money to other uses.
some budget cuts have been made to fund the construction of residences for the general population.

brazil has implemented a law allowing the air force to target drug aircraft in brazil's airspace.
the us is concerned about liability if a civilian plane is misidentified.
brazil announced that the air force will begin shooting down aircraft used to traffic in illegal drugs in brazil's airspace.
before the order to shoot down the plane could be issued, the plan required eight precautionary steps.
prior to the policy taking effect in late october 2004, the publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they needed to file a fly plan.
the original law permitting such actions was approved in 1998, but president fernando henrique cardoso never put the policy into effect.
the united states dissuaded cardoso from signing the decree because of concerns that the accidental downing of a civilian aircraft could expose the government and companies to lawsuits.
in april 2001, the united states reduced its support for the operation targeting drug-running aircraft, after a peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed a peruvian missionary and her child.
the relatives of the victims have sued the us government and won a settlement from it for providing intelligence and technical support for the operation.
the official stated that the us state department --
under certain conditions, us law would forbid assistance to countries implementing the shoot-down law.
the us agrees with brazil's assessment that the threat from drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
the us government consulted the brazilian government on provisions in brazilian law.
brazilian defense minister jose viegas stated that while brazil is encountering difficulties in securing us support for the plan, recent bilateral talks have led to certainty that the brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing brazil to commercial sanctions.
brazilian officials expressed hope that the us would endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
the us is scheduled to provide brazil with 102 million dollars in 2004 in drug aid and law enforcement aid.
former air force chief and current director of the air institute of the rio de janeiro university, general mauro jose miranda gandra stated that the government's measure is a courageous step, but the impact may be more political than practical due to the restrictions imposed by the brazilian government.
brazilian officials stated that the policy could not be applied against aircraft boarded by children.
viegas stated that there is a need for limits.
gandra stated that the provision undermines the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to smuggling aircraft carrying children, which introduces the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
viegas stated in an interview in brasilia that the government should use the law to dissuade drug traffickers from entering brazilian airspace, feeling that the air force is not a threat to them, as they had previously.
the deterioration of the public security situation in sao paulo and particularly rio de janeiro, where powerful and increasingly violent drug gangs are on the increase, has prompted the government to act.
in rio de janeiro, drug gangs have more firepower than the police, have successfully attacked police stations and have forced businesses and schools to close.
in a 2003 interview with a foreign correspondent, president luiz inacio lula da silva stated --
policy is about national sovereignty and national security.
some pilots of drug-running aircraft feel so confident of immunity that they give the brazilian air force pilots pursuing them the obscene gesture.
brazil's constitution is under the prohibition of the death penalty for criminal acts.
some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounts to a de facto death sentence for drug traffickers, contrary to government claims.
the o Estado de sao paolo newspaper in an editorial for the week of 18 july 2004 to 24 july 2004 stated that the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefit.
the extrajudicial application of penalties on things decided by the air force commander in an administrative manner.
these people gained power over the lives and deaths of the crew members and regular fliers.
brazil inaugurated in 2002 the sivam radar system at a cost of $ 1.4 billion which allows the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive amazon region for the first time.
the system uses united states technology.
illegal flights initially declined by 30 percent due to concerns about improved tracking capabilities for traffickers, but subsequently reaccelerated.
brazil recorded 4,128 unauthorized flights in 2003.
some of these flies are illegal under the innocent ranchers who fly between plantations in the amazon.
viegas stated that the deliberate violation of brazilian airspace by smugglers who apparently realize the government is incapable of retaliation has increased significantly.
in april 2001, fernandinho beira-mar, the most notorious drug boss in rio de janeiro, was captured in colombia on a drug-gun pipeline involving left-wing guerrillas.
the northern amazon corridor in brazil has become a busy and increasingly essential route in the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
according to reports, colombian cocaine is being routed through suriname across the northern tier of the amazon region.
colombia is the only country with current policies targeting drug trafficking aircraft.
colombia is the source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the united states.

venezuela (vn)
international; weapons; leader; military
the venezuelan president is worried that his dealings with russia over weapons, curbs on military cooperation with the united states and plans to train 2 million civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion will worry both venezuela and its domestic critics.
chavez, the president of venezuela, is worrying the united states and domestic critics with plans to deal with russia over weapons, curb military cooperation and train 2 million civilians to repel an imperialist invasion.
chavez insisted the move was purely defensive and overdue for venezuela to update its obsolete military hardware and protect itself from nations that might want to control venezuela.
venezuela is the country with the most petroleum production in south america.
domestic opponents of chavez scoffed at the idea of the us ever invading venezuela and charged that chavez was truly intent on arming a huge cadre of loyal reservists to protect against any internal rise-up and posing a militarized counterweight to the us's influence in latin america.
fidel castro, the leader of cuba, is a major ally of chavez and the two have grown closer.
detractors of chavez in the us government say that the strategy of restructuring venezuelan democracy in the image of a militarized socialism in the cuban style could even more troubled chavez's ability to purchase arms and indoctrinate the civilian militias.
us strategists are increasingly concerned about the potential for such a revolution to be fomented by chavez's radical moves, inspired by him.
latin american politics have shifted leftward since the late 1990 s.
this shift to the left is largely a reaction to the perceived failure of free market economics.
the left has elected leaders in brazil, argentina, chile, uruguay, ecuador and venezuela.
chavez's supporters at home countered that the united states has a long history of open and covert intervention in latin america's domestic politics, and said the united states has no right to question venezuela's preparations for defense.
carlos roque espinoza leon said venezuelans never asked what the us marines did.
espinoza leon, a pro-chavez person, is a specialist in defense in the venezuelan national assembly.
espinoza said peru has 500,000 rifles and no one is saying anything.
espinoza said no one complains about the most militarized country in latin america being colombia.
espinoza said the us history is full of aggression in latin america.
espinoza said venezuela must do whatever is necessary to protect the country.
chavez said in his fame that the so-called bolivarian revolution in venezuela was a peaceful event, not an armed one.
chavez was first elected in 1998 and a poll by the independent firm datanalisis rated him at 71 percent popularity.
venezuelan military analyst alberto garrido said chavez was looking for allies to promote a multi-polar world that would counter the us dominance and encourage grass-roots movements in latin america to throw off government influence.
lorenzo campos, a farmer from anzoategui state in northern venezuela, is a reservist and has been trained.
campos said venezuela wants the world to know that it is not prepared to attack anyone and that it is on a mission of protection.
in may 2005, chavez's government announced details of a deal with a russian firm to purchase 100,000 ak-103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each for $ 18.6 million and transfer technology to venezuela for manufacture of the rifles.
the deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle.
the price of these things is considerably less than the $ 825 - $ 850 price of the same weapons ordered through the us mail.
the venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 russian helicopters, 10 spanish transport planes and 6 naval craft from russia.
venezuelan officials said the government was negotiating with brazil to buy around 24 air and train support planes.
chavez insists and even the staunchest military critics here agree that purchases are essential to update weapons like the fal, which is decades old from belgium's military.
retired general fernando ochoa antich said that the statement that chavez is building up the armed forces is an exaggeration.
ochoa was defense minister in 1992 when chavez launched a failed coup.
ochoa stated that venezuela has not purchased arms in the last 25 years and that chavez has not bought weapons aggressively or threateningly against his neighbors.
ochoa said venezuela has never bought arms from russia before and suggested chavez was buying arms to become independent of the us.
ochoa asked why chavez bought the popular caliber rifles in latin america and stated that his political support for the radical leftist movement made him a continental menace.
the pentagon is openly questioning what chavez is doing with the old fal rifles and whether he might be sharing weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in latin america.
the us government has provided no evidence that chavez is arming or funding leftist insurgents.
military analysts say the rebels have plenty of money from drug trafficking to buy weapons and are not interested in old rifles from belgium or chavez's assistance.
a 2003 study published by the us defense intelligence agency reported that more than half of the weapons seized from colombian guerrillas between 1998 and 2001 were of venezuelan origin.
implies that corrupt venezuelan military members or sympathizers could aid the guerrillas.
critics say the new civilian reservists are more distressed by the chavez-opposing military ideology trainings on their minds than the domestic oppositionists.
so chavez called for the revolutionary units to start preparing the public for resistance to the superpower aggressor earlier in 2005 and said that resistance would be the first step in training the active duty armed forces back-up of between 1 million and 2 million volunteers in the coming year.
military analysts estimate venezuela's active duty armed forces number at 83,000.
the person's defense unit was created in the neighborhood, state company and the chavez-established free university and reported directly to the president.
the government insists that the reserve supports the armed forces and will not act against the fifth column against chavez.
espinoza said that reserves should not be used for any shock troops and that each person should decide which side they are on in a civil war.
the general julio ramon quintero viloria is the commander of the reserve.
quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians over 2 halfs of 2005 and over 20 weekends in 2006.
quintero said that venezuelans do not want any colony of any empire and are ready for any possibility.
in june 2005, 100,000 reservists and the venezuelan navy were engaged in a massive war game to repel a stronger invading country.
in june 2005, 40 oil state employees and 1,200 soldiers participated in a similar exercise.
the chavez-friendly circles here are warning of asymmetrical warfare.
asymmetric warfare is a term coined by us strategists to describe conflicts between combatants of unequal strength, where the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
in the past five years, the us government has given colombia $ 330 million in military aid, its most important contribution.
chavez loyalists fear that the us government may instigate a proxy war with venezuela in order to oust chavez and control venezuelan oil.
in an interview, a senior us official dismissed the notion that the us government wants to invade venezuela as utterly complete nonsense.
officials said chavez's side wished to make a negative relationship because chavez calculated politically that he could reach power by constantly confronting the us.
another trouble for the united states is that chavez has rolled back military cooperation and joint exercises.
the us military has had a cooperation office in venezuela for 50 years.
in 2004 chavez shut it down.
5 us military trainers and students participating in the exchange program left the country in april 2005.
analysts say chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
analysts say that chavez's use of that force to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere is unproven.

the north korean government was preparing to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in june 2007 in a first step toward disabling it by december 2007.
secretary of state's assistant secretary of foreign affairs christopher hill stated on june 18, 2007 that the north korean government could prepare to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor by the first step of disabling it by december 2007.
hill is the head negotiator for the united states on north korea's nuclear weapons program.
hill said the stalled dismantlement effort of north korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend visit of international atomic energy agency inspectors, who were invited by pyongyang officials to talk about verification and monitoring of the shutdown.
hill said the shutdown was anticipated to be long following talks with chinese negotiator wu dawei.
hill stated that it is possible to shut down now within a week but not within a month.
the associated press reported that the iaea stated that a team visited pyongyang on june 24, 2007 to discuss the manner of inspectors' verification of shutdown and that the team was in vienna, austria on june 18, 2007.
hill said the iaea inspectors held talks with pyongyang officials about the sealing of the reactor, including the installation of television monitors at the site.
north korean officials refused to proceed with the agreement to begin decommissioning yongbyon until the transfer of the 25 million dollars in funds held in a macao bank account linked to north korea took place.
money was frozen when u.s. officials accused banco delta asia of complicity in north korean financial crimes.
the new york federal reserve bank wired funds to the company on june 14, 2007, after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds.
the fund would be sent to the russian central bank before the transfer of the north korean government's account at the country's commercial bank.
hill said talks with russian, south korean and japanese negotiators on disarmament would take place in the week of june 17.
the talks' timetable was also discussed, involving the set of timetables for the six nations to resume talks on arms control.
under the agreement reached in february 2007, north korean officials pledged to shut down yongbyon and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for 50,000 tons of fuel oil.
in return for the further 950,000 tons of fuel oil, north korean officials declared all nuclear programs and disabled all facilities in the next phase of the agreement.
hill stated that the next phase of the agreement could be concluded by december 2007 technically.

the pirates approached a deal to release the ship, which was hijacked by somali pirates carrying a large cargo of arms.
questions emerge regarding the arms shipments to kenya and possible clandestine deals with south sudan.
on 08 october 08 maritime officials and associates of the somali pirates who hijacked the ukrainian freighter carrying large cargo of arms on 25 september 080000 said the pirates could collect their ransom soon.
after difficult negotiations involving several people involved in a bazaar-style haggling, the parties reached a deal that included a $ 100 million payment to pirates and the freeing of ships.
ahmed omar ahmed, a businessman in xarardheere, somalia, said pirates had agreed to a ransom of approximately $ 8 million u.s. dollars for the ship's owners and that the ship could be freed on or around october 8 or 9, 2008.
xarardheere, a notorious pirate city on the coast of somalia.
kenyan maritime officials stated that there are yet to be agreements on critical details.
such details involve pirates requesting guarantees that the current armada of united states warships encircling pirates will not arrest or attack pirates.
a kenyan maritime official said such negotiations are complex and involve more than financial aspects.
officials stated on 08 october 2008 that progress was made and that the parties had agreed on an approach.
the pirates initially requested 35 million u.s. dollars and then reduced it to 20 million u.s. dollars.
the pirates have consistently expressed their willingness to negotiate financial figures.
more than 25 ships were hijacked off the coast of somalia in 2008, typically ransomed for between $ 1 and $ 200,000.
ukraine ship and cargo and the 20 sailors on board were released in exchange for a payment of $ 100,000 in united states dollars and a pirate's preferred 100 dollar bill.
the original destination countries of the arms shipments that boarded ukrainian ships were -
the kenyan government claimed that the weapons were being shipped to the kenyan military shortly after the hijacking of the freighter on 25 september 2008.
ships via mombasa, kenya's main port.
the weapons on board include 33 t-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
subsequently, evidence emerged of weapons in the kenyan-southern sudanese clandestine arms deal.
if the pirates did not hijack the ship and did not begin speaking to the media via satellite phone, the deal is most likely to remain secret.
ukrainian officials are adamant in denying any wrongdoing.
ukraine's diplomat in kenya oleh belokolos stated --
ukraine has no supplies of any armament to the south sudan government and has no plans to do so.
all appropriate paperwork has been validated.
ukraine will abide by all un rules and agreements on arms control.
ukraine inherited an enormous stockpile of weaponry after the soviet union collapsed and is now dealing in major arms deals.
the deal is suspicious because kenya relies most on the united kingdom and other western countries for heavy weapons supplies.
kenyan politicians have demanded answers and called for several commissions to examine the situation.

the united states military stated that it would prioritize ensuring that the shipment of weapons did not unload and that the weapons would not be sold to islamist insurgents in somalia.

u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said that afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban have cut back on poppy cultivation and are stockpiling raw opium in order to support the price and preserve the major source of insurgent financing.
u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said that afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban have cut back cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in order to support the price and preserve the major source of insurgent financing.
costa said this to reporters last week as the u.n. drug office prepared to release its latest survey of afghanistan's opium crop.
the survey showed that poppy cultivation has retreated much in afghanistan and is overwhelmingly concentrated in the 34 of the 7 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, mostly in the southern provinces.
the survey was issued on november 27, 2008.
the united nations found that the amount of land devoted to opium production in afghanistan was reduced by 19 percent, despite a just 6 percent drop in total production of opium.
the study attributes high output per acre to good growing seasons in the south.
the heavy irrigation of the south, where the taliban maintains a strong presence in five provinces and systematically encourages opium cultivation to finance the taliban insurgency for several years.
the u.n. estimates that insurgents made much more than $ 300 million from opium trading last year.
costa said that the war effort could be funded by between 200 million and 3 billion dollars.
the taliban produced an amount of opium that far exceeded world demand, due to three successive bumper crops in a row.
costa said the result was a glut caused by prices dropping by approximately 20 percent.
costa said the evidence that prices have already collapsed and that taliban, drug lords and even some farmers are stockpiling opium.
the amount of increase is also taking place in afghanistan.
costa added that insurgents were holding a significant amount of opium.
costa said that the surplus was as much as 11000 tons (equivalent to more than twice the world's demand three years ago) and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
the united nations found that afghanistan produced 8,500 tons of opium in 2008.
world demand is estimated at about 4,400 tons per year.
this year the taliban stood passively by as the cultivation took place and put less pressure on afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
then this supports the current price.

the citizen newspaper stated that the south african foreign ministry announced on 5 october 2001 that the south african government had imposed a ban on mercenary activities following reports that 1000 muslims who had been trained in military enlistment were leaving the country to fight for the taliban in afghanistan at the behest of the united states.
the report claims that muslims against illegitimate leaders (maill) made the claim that 1,000 muslims with military training had volunteered to serve and were receiving backing from local businessmen.
the report claims that 1,000 muslims all in military training are over 18 years old.
the muslims against illegitimate leaders (mali) is a group based in cape town.
the muslim judicial council refutes the report.
the south african foreign ministry stated that south africa's foreign military assistance act prohibits recruitment of people, either within south africa or outside south africa, as mercenaries or as foreign military assistance.
the foreign military assistance and assistance act of south africa, which is the law under which the offer was made, does not allow a person to offer military assistance to any state, state organ, group or other country unless the national conventional arms control committee grants permission.
the foreign military assistance act of south africa renders foreign military assistance only according to an agreement approved by the national conventional arms control committee.

technology and international.
the hong kong university collaborates with mainland universities and mainland businesses and mainland government sectors to coordinate training programs and research centers to promote the commercialization of high-tech research and technology transfer.
in 2004, hong kong's tertiary institutes contributed to the improvement of hong kong's relations with the mainland of china in terms of high technology research and development activities.
the university of hong kong collaborates with the tertiary education sector, the business sector and the government sector in mainland china to direct training programs and research centers to promote commercialization of research and technology transfer.
in june 2004, hong kong polytechnic university joined the hong kong-based national science and technology park's virtual university park in shenzhen, china, becoming the first tertiary institute in hong kong to establish research centers and training facilities on the mainland.
polyu president poon chung-kwong stated that the public and private sectors in hong kong will strengthen their connections with the mainland china in various areas.
poon said that hong kong-china cooperation would facilitate the university's more effective promotion of technology transfer to and human resource development in mainland china, creating positive results for both hong kong and china.
in june, the city university of hong kong signed an agreement with the university of science and technology of china in anhui province to establish a joint high-level research center in suzhou.
the chinese academy of sciences established the university of science and technology of china.
the agreement is based on the principle of mutually beneficial collaboration between the two universities to complement each other's strengths in order to work together on joint research projects, supervise research students, teach and administer professional training opportunities.
in addition to partnering with educational institutes, the university of hong kong has also joined a large-scale high-tech exchange program with mainland china to enhance communication between mainland and hong kong in the discipline.
hong kong university of science and technology (hkust) demonstrated its latest achievements in research and development at the sixth annual china hi-tech fair held in shenzhen in october 2004.
hkust demonstrated more than 30 new technologies and new products covering a wide range of technologies, including nanotechnology, multimedia, logistics, radio frequency identification technology, advanced manufacturing and biotechnology.
hkust is also collaborating with a mainland manufacturer to develop high-capacity lithium batteries based on nanomaterials.
this is the most recent collaboration in a series of technology transfer agreements reached by hkust and successfully reached.
hkust president paul ching-wu chu stated --
hkust has increased funding for research into new technologies required by the pearl river delta's industries.
the university will continue to leverage its extensive relations with international research institutions and multinational corporations to enhance the development of advanced technologies with immediate and practical applications in china.
i am 24 years old and my mother is 2.5 years old.
i have been broken up with my sons father since august.
i want to start dating other people and my son's father said nothing to do with him if he starts dating other people.
he is very possessive and controlling, but that doesn't mean we are right together.
he's going on too much with his life right now and he thinks we can work but i've told him several times that i don't love him and he doesn't love me.
i want him to be there for his son, not because i need him too.
he had no one, and his family didn't get along with him and had issues with him.
i don't want to be miserable anymore and i'm more miserable when he's around longer.
i don't want him to be there because he's a good father or at least trying to be.
i believe every child needs both parents, whether together or not.
but he thought i couldn't have no one if he couldn't have me.
what am i doing with my life?
your ex-significant other is very bad to threaten you using your son.
you cann't give in to that or it just escalates.
you are right to live your life and be happy, because he is not a threat to you.
he would see people regardless, but this is just the typical method he uses.
other people say it's like killing myself if you leave me. does it get through to you?
date: you.
meet all kinds of people.
do what you want.
if his price for walking out of your both lives was not voluntary, you'd probably be better off without him.
i agree, other than that he's not in business, you're on the date or not date.
i didn't tell him.
he wasn't threatening you, he wasn't concerned about your personal life.
did you document the threats he made?
you really need this.
quit taking his calls and make him leave voice mail.
make him email or text you.
keep that record.
get a lawyer and divorce.
try to get legal aid if you can't afford one.
tell your ex-significant other that all communication needs to go through a lawyer.
the bus driver, the people till, and the people delivering your food want exactly the same change.
do they realize that you don't get a pile of change from the bank?
does someone have to take notes somewhere?
people get lazy.
i'm like the closest to the possible, because i don't like counting copper all day.
if you take a twenty pound note on the bus, they'll just tell you to get on the bus, because they're hell lazy.
it is not illegal to pay a certain amount in coins for example you can only pay 30 pence in pennies.
hello, i started university in september but obviously i didn't gel immediately with most people.
i do know that my adjustment will take some time, i am very introverted, shy, especially anxious and all the rest.
on my first night here, all my housemates went out and it was the hardest thing i've ever had to do.
i went by myself to bars, sober.
here's the point:
i didn't enjoy university after about 5 months here, i was disillusioned, i didn't enjoy the set project and i didn't like the course delivery much.
the university is making out much better than it seems.
i started off badly, financing for students is delayed and added to my stress levels, so worried i couldn't progress with my work, so it's all piled up in conclusion.
i was assigned a counselor at the university and saw him in a block session about 5-6 weeks and it really didn't work out because i never opened up to him, if i'm being honest.
only half hearted.
i'm loaded with work now, neck deep, and have major deadlines to hit, i'm depressed and the anxiety results in me feeling miserable all the time.
i have no longer a counselor, because you can only have a person at a time in so many sessions, and i doubt that it would help me much if it was not already helping me.
i lack motivation, i don't feel comfortable with my lecturer, and i feel like i want to give in but i cann't because i'm going to end up with a dead end job and i aspire to be someone.
i'd rather die than be uneducated and not live the life i want to live and the matter worsens when i drop out of university.
i'm 21 years old and turning 22 this year, i don't have much time to fail and i have to do something.
i didn't want to go over and over the system and fail consistently. i failed college once and did another course to try to get into university.
maybe someone could advise me on some of this?
and you can go and see your doctor and see if there is a way for you to extend your deadline to try and ease the pressure a bit.
send an email like this to your tutor, they will consider the circumstances, don't worry, they have seen all before. i know, i work in the university administration department.
break your work into manageable chunks.
concentrate on one bit of work at a time, the most urgent assignment obviously.
shut off your housemate and do well because you are trying something new from the very beginning. keep it now.
i would recommend that you go see your doctor too.
you might benefit from speaking to someone if you are always anxious, my friend got therapy from the nhs because of anxiety and it was really normal.
ok, try to get an extension. i'm sure your university will allow it if you're honest.
it's hard to keep strong and keep carrying on with life.
my mum divorced, she had horrible times with my stepfather and she was sent round the bend by the freedom she found.
she has epilepsy and manic depression with huge anger problems.
she is constantly horrible to me.
i couldn't cope with her outbursts and hateful nasty remarks when i was at home.
i was 18 years old at the time and studying full time at a private school with high pressure at sixth form and i had a 95 % bursary.
i cann't work from home because she shouts at me.
then i was angry at my teachers because of that.
she was lovely, just like i have my mummy back, then she turned into the most spiteful living human next minute.
i have already passed my a2 exams and i have already accepted that i will be defeated and that this year of my life will make me fail.
i don't know if i can come back to this, but the university has offered me the most amazing offer, but i cann't even accept it. i've never made a grade in my life.
i wish i could wipe her out from my life, but things are so much better without her.
then i thought i was just being selfish.
no, i don't mean to say that my life is like this, surely.
it is much better.
but i feel like i'm not in control of this downhill spiral.
and i don't know what to do.
thank you for reading.
nice vent.
you cann't get her section for that.
even if she has a history of mental illness or a diagnosis?
you don't know for sure you won't get a good grade, so you accept the place if possible.
life throws things at you all the time.
if you are not part of your family, you are an outsider.
i have dealt with verbal abuse from my dad for 8 years before i came to university and i am honestly here only because there is no other way out of it.
if you really want out, work hard.
really, if she cann't give you consistent support, you need to get it somewhere else.
can you call childline or something like it?
you can go to the library on saturday and study for 8 hours good.
can you go to your friend's house to form a study group?
she's the section that's a bit painful in the arse and you're blaming her for all your problems, so do you want her?
i know how you feel.
my mum spits too from hell.
i would highly recommend taking up smoking.
oh tsr grow up and stop nagging it's a joke.
i think i became a much weaker person in the last 2 years and i have been trying to dull down my personality to try to befriend some people at university.
but people are led by the niceness of the person to believe that they can say whatever they want to me or do whatever they want to me.
they show absolutely no respect.
i say hello to someone at the university, they ignore me, but 30 minutes later they decide they want my help with some work and i give it.
it's caused a lot of anger and distress in my life and it's really started to affect my concentration at university.
anyone get any experience handling things like this or how to go about getting some respect back again?
you just say no.
if it's not particularly comfortable for you, do it gradually.
you can start with " sorry i'm not busy "
of course you wouldn't go over the top with it, you wouldn't go in the complete opposite direction.
if you don't think about it in your mind, you're not going to say no.
when they start to realize that you are not going to bend backwards over for them, they start to respect you more.
this is really well, this is really bad attitude, of course you can be respected, if you are not nice, but just let them do anything to you, then you are not nice, that is not nice, that is a fool.
i don't know if anyone will read this, but i just feel despair and i need to tell someone.
i left home in september and started university, i was incredibly anxious about doing this but delayed thinking about it until i got here, now i'm here and have been for over two weeks, i feel overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and awkward socially.
i've been struggling emotionally since i moved to secondary school, losing my dad around the age of 9 and always blaming it on how i felt, since 20091200 to this year around march i've had 2 periods of counselling, roughly 15 months.
i feel like i'm in the midst of something that resembles an overwhelming problem in my life that is credible and i'm making myself doubt my self esteem that has always been low and i'm incapable of concentrating on work and i find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions often and i doubt anything and everything.
my two counselors did not diagnose me with depression and suggested i was not suffering from depression, but depression was a huge worry for me because my dad died of depression and suicide.
i've tried to solve my problems before, i've found particular exercise and meditation useful, i've also tried things like self help books and tapes. generally, i feel this is my life, but i'm not sure. i've wasted one chance at existence and one chance at being a young man. i'm beating this feeling away.
i don't know what i'm doing, i never follow through on what i think i'm doing, my friends often say i'm lazy, i can't disagree a lot of the time, i feel like people are trying everything they can to help me, and i fail again and again.
sorry to anyone who has read this jumble of a mess and i do feel a bit like a self-seeking moaner but i am truly desperate.
when people are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into a new role (e.g. university student), their feelings of self-worth become more intense.
i am not a health professional, i can only speak from my own personal experience, so i would strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional for your depression and your worries about depression.
snt1 most people feel awkward and unintelligent when they first get to university, so you're definitely not alone there. snt2 i would really recommend you get an appointment with the counselling service at your university, i mean really. snt3 it doesn't really matter if anyone tells you you're depressed or not, you have some problems obviously, and you can use some support. snt4 you have some problems, and you can use some support, but it's not as important as the experience you're having. snt5 the label is not as important as the experience you're having. snt6 really helpful are meditation and exercise, so try and do that. snt7 but you have to engage with help and general life to get somewhere, but you don't have to beat yourself up because you don't feel motivated to do anything at any given moment. snt8 a lot of people feel like this, and it's a hopeful thing to pass when you begin to feel better. you're not the only one feeling like this. snt9 you're not kind to yourself, and you need to get some help.
good luck.
i think a lot of people feel the same way you do, but they are medicated with their friends, and i think that's probably not the solution, but definitely being around your friends when you are depressed is better than being alone and depressed. either way, if you feel like you want to message me privately, you have my fancy.
i focus on idols if you are me, you aspire to be someone like someone who comes from a bad background and ends up succeeding, happy, having a family, marrying etc etc but you don't want to be them, you admire and respect them.
you are focussed on what you have achieved in life, you are not stating what you have studied or indeed why you have studied it, you want to experience it, your mum wants you to go, you need a degree for the career you want.
so you sum up why you're there and work your butt off to get the best grade you can because when you get your degree you have something to say like " hey, i didn't fail, i worked hard and passed "
x
i hope this helps.
i'm pretty much not autistic, i walk on my toes all the time, but i think the doctor misdiagnosed me.
i'm more comfortable with it.
so why did they make the decision to signal autism by walking on toes? because it seems so random and it's not always indicated.
well, i could have something that signals something on the autism spectrum, but you don't have one or two of those things.
you guys know what i mean.
walking on toes is a symptom of autism.
headaches are a symptom of brain tumors.
feeling tired a lot could be a symptom of leukaemia.
the symptoms are not always applied, but it is worth noting that in this instance it is clear that there are a lot of cases where the symptoms occur, so there is never a diagnosis without the note.
i'm walking on my toes, but i'm bearing with strange under-curled toes that had to have surgery 2 years ago.
my brother is autistic, but i didn't notice it either, so the spectrum is so broad, and i probably have a mild form of asperger's, which is why i have communication problems and don't pick up on social/body language.
then i don't have the proper diagnosis and you might even have some symptoms but that doesn't necessarily mean you have a certain condition.
i don't walk on my toes much because i was told not to for years and years.
i have dyspraxia.
so you could be dyspraxic or have short tendons.
i've drill it myself and i find it more comfortable now.
i read too much of that kind of random symptom, too.
hello, i am 12 years old (2 days after my 13 th birthday) and i am addicted to self harm.
i started cutting my own fingernails at age 7 and never stopped from that day on.
it got worse because i had a scar on my leg from when i slit it open to staple the name of my ex boyfriend because i didn't stop the cut when i was bleeding.
i have several slits in my arms.
they healed and i then cut them out with the staples and razor i had robbed from school.
i took around 5 paracetamol and other drugs with lager and vodka when it was impossible to find a cutting tool.
i'm really tempted to cut off my arms or burn myself to write this.
i'm an addict, i'll cut again when one heals.
i think about it every day.
i'm 12 years old and my life is already sick.
this is what happened: when i was 7 years old my dad left and didn't want to know me anymore.
he just cares about his little new girl, his wife and his new life that i don't want.
my best mate died when i was 10 years old.
i am 16 and i am forbidden to speak to boys because of the event and the age difference.
my mum also suffers from bipolar and i have depression.
i don't want to stop.
i don't care what i do, i want to do it over and over again to torture myself, i hate myself.
but i love my best mate to bits, he means the world to me and if he did anything i would do anything.
i wouldn't tell him, but he'll find out.
i don't want to hurt him, he doesn't want to hurt me.
what do i do?
thank you for reading.
are you on any drugs or do drugs get any therapy?
talk to your school nurse or gp and tell them what's going on.
maybe your trusted person who you told could be a school teacher.
if you tell them, they can help you.
if you keep bottling it up inside, it's only going to get worse.
i trust you, but it's better to get this thing out of the way as early as possible instead of letting it get even worse.
don't do this.
i'm 17 and i started self harming last year by cutting my main arm. i stopped a few months ago.
it's hard but you can do it.
i feel so much happier but when i see the scar it reminds me of how i felt at that time and how strong the feeling was that i wanted to do such things to myself.
it's also strong, you can do it. i find salvation in writing poetry and keeping a journal.
self harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
remember, self harm is not a definition of who you are.
you can overcome it.
so i think i got ocd so i found myself always checking things that belonged to me to ensure i didn't lose or leave anything behind when i went out especially to university and that's what caused me to think i got ocd.
i often have to check twice a go, and after 30 seconds i cann't resist checking again for some reason.
what caused this?
am i crazy or something?
it is often carried by many things, and even still checked on a daily basis, is this any extent of ocd?
i can't do this, what is this?
i get very anxious if i don't check, often to the point of anxiety that i can't wait that long.
i feel doomed if i lose my wallet or phone.
i just wish i could go out without worrying about leaving something or losing something every two minutes.
i really don't know what to do and i'm afraid to go to a general practitioner.
they probably never heard of some compulsion like this and i just don't know what to do.
have any of you had a ritual like this?
people think i'm crazy but it's very difficult to get out of this.
what advice can you give me?
i used to do this on my way to college, and i had a list of things i knew i had, and i used to be compulsive about checking on the bus.
i know it's easier to say than do, i have more severe anxiety now and think this is a warning sign, so you just try to wean the habit when it's relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor, not just tell yourself to keep checking this out.
don't worry about that, the doctor saw a much worse case.
i did ocd today in psych class.
you just avoided compulsive action, so don't check to see if you lost something, just leave it.
the level of anxiety will increase over time, but hopefully your ocd will gradually decrease, so that over time it will disappear.
that just sounds like you're anxious instead of having a really bad ocd.
i am obsessed with checking all the locks in my house every 20 nights.
sometimes i'm convinced they're not locked, even though i know they are.
when your routine is really interrupted by obsessive interruptions, i think it becomes a real problem.
you're not crazy, so don't worry, and i'm sure your gp will understand the issue.
i also went for therapy for other reasons and they encouraged me to pick a number less than 20 to check and stick to and cut down.
i think my idea is good, and i'm still ok if i check 5 times or 20 times.
i'm a lot better so far, and i definitely think anyone who wants improvement will definitely improve.
i'm usually pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and i'm not too worried about it.
i was not anxious about it before now for a month or two, but i was not talking about mere feeling nervous blue.
i started to feel panicky, not because i was worried about things i hadn't worried about before, but even things that i hadn't worried about before, that crossed my mind as something that caused alarm bells to ring in my head.
i'm not sure whether this is because of changes in lifestyle (ie free care going to unemployed graduates) or whether this is a sign of other issues. but this is beginning to bug me because it affects my confidence and happiness.
i spoke to a few people, including my parents, but all think i'm going through a random phase and should hold off on acting until the serious problems are cleared up.
so what is the best thing to do?
you speak to the doctor and see if there is a pill for anxiety that can take the edge off.
do i see a possibility of speaking to a counselor?
or should i take the advice of my close friends and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem?
well, i wouldn't start trying to eye your anxiety, it'll make me tense and more likely to panic more. there's a circle of death there.
i would recommend that you try to focus on something that will guarantee you a smile or a feeling of being happier, as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky.
or if you cann't do that, you get your friends to make you laugh when you start feeling panicky, and i'll work it and suffer random panic attacks, loudly laughing.
it just started to worry me really, but not as much as you, because it doesn't sound as severe as you.
i find just talking to someone else about the things that make you anxious helps.
i found it perhaps in a non-moaning way that i was able to make myself feel better about it by knowing that it was a big deal but not something i needed to be anxious about.
if it worsens, go to the doctor.
i have a friend who has severe anxiety that prevents him from leaving the house and doing things, so he worries that something might go wrong and he's that anxious.
the doctor gave her medication and she made much better.

it took it a long time.
in late 2004, route 288, a circumferential highway running around the southwest quadrant of the richmond new urban region, opened.
it has already changed the development pattern and caused localized traffic congestion around its exits.
the richmond times dispatch today told the tale of the impact of the huguenot trail in powhatan county.
will jones reported that traffic on one section of huguenot trail has more than doubled since the opening of 288.
the surge in speed and accidents is also happening.
so far this year, 17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of winterfield road, up from 12 all of last year.
dale totten, an engineer with the virginia department of transportation, said that if the state had more money, it would add four lanes to the road at a cost of about $ 13 million.
of course, vdot doesn't have the money to construct roads in the richmond region.
the reason vdot spent all of its frigging money on 288 is because of local politicians and boosters.
where is homer simpson when you need him?
this is a major moment.
we predict that route 288 will generate residential development in the scarce-populated area around all of the road's exits, overtaxing a local country road.
others may choose where to work and where to live, but limited access highways can relieve traffic for drivers between chesterfield and goochland counties back and forth.
they will create traffic congestion in the new places.
only the rapidity of this surprises me.
i even think it could be 3 or 4 years.
think about it, roads create all exits, so think about the fact that route 288 has already created a road construction costing $ 13 million just at this one exit.
another predictable thing.
after a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of a mega-commerce project at the intersection of 288 and a major road, the need for new roads soars.
well, we may see liability for the unfunded liability zoom past the original $ 400 million well before the end of the decade.
the idea is that of a brainiac who thinks such an idea is a great one for route 288.
thank you for nothing.
i think we could spend 4 billion dollars elsewhere better.
i think you shouldn't blame 288 for creating those people.
if they are enough to create new traffic congestion in the new place, then...
will the traffic congestion in the old place be additional?
now you understand what tmt in fairfax feels.
i usually take the road position.
however, 288 is definitely excessive with glaring needs in other parts of the state.
richmond has virtually no traffic.
the rush hour lasted 30 minutes.
and you gave them the beltway through a large rural area.
road to nowhere.
think you can just spend this money on another potomac river crossing or desperately needed road improvements in nova.
the insult is that the state's rest helped pay for 288 in last year's budget deal, adding insult to injury, and that wiped out the debt.
very nice of you all to oblige us.
but there is not much sense in that.
it's the same problem as it was.
if you get ahead of the need, you are to blame for sprawl.
if you build in places where there is already an acute need, you cann't pave your own way out of congestion.
anonymous
that's a fair point.
5:26 made a good point.
this situation, however, hammers home the validity of the things that the state auditor's people have reported finding, that the ctb and vdot funds for transportation projects are based on the best lobbying, instead of on the state's comprehensive transportation plan.
i submit this is a situation that is not to be tolerated and is a disgrace.
and senator chichester and his toady pour more money into this flawed institution, making it worse.
what is the purpose of expending transportation funds?
in virginia it is for the benefit of private business plans and not for the public interest.
you're dead wrong.
walter stosch stated that the money for economic development was intended to pay for the 288.
come on folk.
tmt, i don't understand your point.
you'll be stuck in traffic last time you're not destined for some sort of business or from it.
as a whole, it seems the roads are there to facilitate the public's interest in getting into and from private businesses.
business support is overwhelming, but it's sunday, grandma's trip, soccer game, of course.
we wouldn't suffer from congestion problems if our expenditures on roads didn't not match the increase in business or domestic or state products.
if we recognize that the primary benefit of roads is to business, then we should do two things:
businesses will pay more for what they pass us of course, and we will incentivize businesses to locate where they will at least be stressing the system the least, even if that means more overall travel.
why is it so hard to understand?
to solve the pattern of human settlement function and the balance of transport system capacity and travel demand generated by land use.
all else is spin.
emr
tmt said it was for the benefit of private business plans and not for the public interest in virginia.
i don't see the point of this statement because it appears to demonize private business plans and put public interest above all else.
i think they are intertwined tightly because they are virtually the same.
the problem is local because this cookie dough is lumpy.
however, in the event that we demonize business long enough, we will eventually find ourselves all working for the devil.
i don't see why the claim that the balance of a dynamic, ever-changing natural is being solved.
you even see positive rail to dulles because the airport is a job center that promotes bidirectional demand.
i agree.
in fact, that reason alone is in fact sufficient, all by itself.
all i'm saying is that the same logic should be applied to roads.
they should have a destination at the end of both so that we can use our investment to the maximum.
we need more places to get closer to the balance that you say we need.
check reality here.
i drive past watkins landing every morning and evening.
i commute back and forth from my work location on huguenot trail.
i never saw anything remotely resembling a traffic flood.
it is in a 55 mph zone where cars are going between 75 and 100 in the morning.
the huguenot trail has already been widened because of heavy development demands from the chesterfield side, a new school, and a whole bunch of developments that have existed for years and have been funneled through robious road for years.
288 is wonderful instead of the bottleneck that lack of road would be for powhatan and west chesterfield county.
we can develop our commerce and work closer to our lives.
you might think that land is being used in an irrational manner.
i don't desire to live in any city.
i refuse to work in the downtown area.
i refuse to use mass transit that is unsafe for female commuters working long hours outside regular work hours.
and i would like to see a lot of development happen.
i don't exactly understand how i'm keeping horses on a quarter acre lot that i'm supposed to.
one gallon of gas could go for $ 10.
and i still pay taxes in the country.
many people legitimately prefer horses, hunting, gardens, and certain types of small businesses over living in the urban core.
this baffles me truly, i am baffled by this infatuation with city living.
anonymous 6:37 am, if you wish to live in the country, you have every right to do so.
you're not right that the rest of the state should underwrite the construction of a 4 billion dollar highway to make shopping and getting to work easier.
the 288 road debate has consistently overlooked other things that could have been spent for $ 400 million.
if money is applied to other pressing road projects or even non-road projects, much of the traffic congestion can be alleviated.
ray hyde, i would direct your comments to investors who are lobbying for roads to be placed near their own property and to the incompetent and unfunded system that is requesting this regardless of whether the link to the master transportation plan is there or not.
