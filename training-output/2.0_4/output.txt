support the person who started the thread resolutely, i am replying to compose a poem.
pledge to fight to the death to defend the diaoyu islands and related islands.
they bumped the fishing fleet, stirring up trouble and unrest, they showed their wolfish appearance again with a stolen heart and arrogant form.
never go back to that time when we appeared to be humiliated when we signed the treaty, china is strong, the sword should be sharp and the knife should be shiny, let's bury the approaching enemy.
2010-09-11
i agree with the analysis of the person who started the thread. if a real war comes, i would like to be named hua mulan to protect our home and defend our homeland, to spread the prestige of our china, and to pledge to fight to the death to defend our national dignity.
i wish i could bear that passionate and upsurge long march of mao zedong to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all the enemies of china and spread our dragon's prestige.
how long will we tolerate japan?
fellow citizens,
hello everyone, we all know about the september 18 th incident, japan now has a premeditated plan to repeat another similar incident at sea, the lugou bridge incident.
japan surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world and openly invaded our sacred territory, the diaoyu islands.
the diaoyu islands belong to china, we all know that, because of historical reasons, what belongs to us originally has become controversial.
fellow citizens, i say we are what we are and why the need for negotiation? because japan is going even further, wanting to create a fact of occupation. can we allow this? absolutely not.
i say to my fellow citizens, japan's militarism brought grave disasters to the asian people.
china suffered from japanese ravages for several decades long.
the japanese unit 731 experimented on chinese, korean and other people with extremely brutal methods on human bodies in northeast china cruelly. the nanjing massacre added a layer of blood that will never fade away from the ancient capital. over 1000 kilometers away, the bloody and big battle in hengyang and changsha barely left any bones of the dead. everything was killed off.
i would say there are too many instances of heinous crimes committed by japan in china that are difficult to record without exhausting all the bamboo strips.
just like those deceased millions of souls that lost their lives wandering over the pacific ocean and finding it difficult to rest in peace.
all those who experienced that era still remember it vividly, and even our younger generation cries tears down our cheeks and boils our blood in indignation whenever we turn the page of this history and read it.
actually, it is japanese wanting to reverse the verdict on japan's aggressive history that has woken up fellow citizens and chinese in asia.
we must go forward, despite the pain of looking back at this shameful 100 years; let us create history and choose history, but history will not resolve the issues.
we have no fear because we are responsible; the territory is small, but it is related to matters of dignity; the honor is guaranteed by the interests of the country and the nation, regardless of how the wind and clouds change; we cannot let our native land be separated, even if it is scarred with wounds.
i say to my fellow citizens that the 21 st century is an adventurous time for china, we are beset with difficulties from within, but pressured from without, and we face many challenges.
how should we go about the taiwan, tibet, south china sea, surrounding environment and foreign forces (chinese aggressive) issues?
fellow citizens, i say, what do? look at the world map, and the crescent-shaped encirclement is suppressing our breath, strangling our development, coveting our national territory.
we never fear people, we don't want to make our enemies, we don't fear war, we don't want war.
we must urgently arrange our arms and strengthen all our military forces on land, sea and air.
china has flourished several times over the past several thousand years, but never has it had the ambition to expand its territory outward.
we do not impose on others what we do not want for ourselves, so we follow a strategic foreign security philosophy of benevolence and virtue.
like the country's tolerance and liberalness, it is individual tolerance and liberalness, which means we have to insist that we will not hurt others, but avoid being hurt ourselves.
tolerance is not certain fear, and sincerity is not obligatory cowardice.
china's exemption of japan from war repairs due to world war ii serves the benevolent peace.
i would like to say to my fellow citizens that the people's heroes monument is a condensed history of the chinese nation that is striving for continued improvement.
solemn and magnificent posturing represents sacred expectations of peace.
occasionally my memory strings are agitated by the many heroic and tragic scenes that spring up in my mind of shining spears and armored horses.
i went through that yellow history page, like seeing kangxi emperor, who contemplated how to achieve unification of the territory alone in his audience hall hundreds of years ago, and also abraham lincoln, who wandered alone in the dark great hall, thinking of the integrity of the union.
the world is peaceful, but forgetting the war is certainly dangerous. i, fellow citizens, want development and peace, but we must never exercise forbearance blindly. the boxer protocol, which betrayed and humiliated the nation, aggravated china's poverty and backwardness in modern times. falling behind is the bully.
how can there be peace when there is no strength?
we must focus on national defense education, build up a great wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people, and establish a full-range national defense system capable of attacking and defending.
the best defense is offense, strengthen the force that can engage in an attack of the utmost range, improve the deep and great combat capability in all aerospace. imperative: increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment, establish a high-tech elite division of high quality, premised on avoiding the influence of national economic development.
the battle horns are about to sound, people are already fully equipped and ready to go.
without the support of the people we accomplish nothing, but with their support we are all powerful.
fellow citizens, it is time for us to say no to others. we must achieve.
1. establishing a guarantee fund, improving the working environment and working mechanism, and recruiting back to china hundreds of thousands of information technology professionals who have emigrated to the united states and around the world.
2. create a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
3. manufacture 5,000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds.
4. accelerate research and deployment of high speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles that could break missile defense systems.
5. resume nuclear experiments and establish military forces in space.
6. retain 1,000 nuclear bombs the equivalent of 100 million tons of trinitrotoluene and install nuclear warheads on all short and medium range missiles when needed.
7. retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
8. abandon your commitment to first use nuclear weapons.
9. retain the right to preemptive strikes when national security is threatened.
fellow citizens, i believe that only if we are confident in ourselves and improve ourselves, we can strive to be strong. qin shi huang unified china, zheng chenggong recovered taiwan, we must carry on the far-sightedness, insight and strong will of our predecessors.
now that piece of land that is trembling far from the embrace of motherland is shaking and moaning and calling out to us fellow citizens, let us carry forward what was not fulfilled by the previous generations with courageous forward movement.
as i read history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmer into concern for the nation. i will serve our motherland as a volunteer to make her prosper and be splendid once again. i am willing to bear the cloth gown and be included in the common people. i will show my sincere and patriotic heart to heaven.
here i compose poems in the classical form, ci, to voice the aspirations of my heart.
paint a deep red lip.
protect the diaoyu islands.
we lost our ryukyu islands bitterly.
how can we allow diaoyu islands to fall into other countries?
a hundred years of vicissitude
smoke and cloud chase the flying wave.
the youngest brother is still a tender youth.
wandered in all directions and bore seals.
flagged for looking over.
we brandished our weapons and crossed eastward.
let the horses drink from the pacific ocean.

why didn't we fight the little japan?
what is still tolerated by the chinese?
they even ride on our heads.
do the chinese still have the guts to do this?
we should tell the whole world that china cannot be bullied at will.
it's time we showed our strength, china is too calm.
our citizens' lives are all too carefree at the moment, officials are too extravagant.
we don't have cohesion now already, china needs to start a war, the face of the countries that follow the us rear will be harshly slapped.
let them know the us is not a panacea, if we win, china's influence can increase, and the cohesion of the citizens can be improved, if we lose, we can clean out the incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out, let china have new blood and update.
china, go!
i suggest that china strengthen its guard of the diaoyu islands, and guard them every day, and protect the fishermen and our country's sovereignty. if japan dares to invade our territory by military force, we will fight a small scale war to defend ourselves, regardless of the cost. china cannot lose.
we need to show in life, but really, showing that you are someone's embrace is p.
i just passed by.
this is like the whole society with stars.
damn, not sexy.
it cannot be accepted in its totality.
just a cheap entertainment person, there is somewhat of a sense of their reputation in feudal china.
their lives were glorious.
a group of nine professionals.
life is hard
shocked.
that's normal, and whores are always heartless and unrighteous performers.
they want the money but not the face.
look at the wolf near ms. fan with glasses, you know that if he did not act, he would have to drink with him, or be forced out, or even not even framed.
son of a bitch
ok as long as there's something loveliness to eat.
no one is easy, like life is a show, you have to look at the script to know how to perform.
all somebody.
the top scorer in the imperial examinations has walked 360 times in his life, so much effort and endeavor behind him, this humiliates the word " bean vermicelli ".
haha...
overdoing
reality...
shoot that hooligan.
cheap performers
cheap performers
the entertainment circle is dirty, all the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
pity them, but who's to blame?
everybody does this, how can you make money if you don't?
a woman is proud in front of others but melancholy when alone.
in ancient times, the popular prostitutes were just the stars nowadays, they are famous stars, so it is just normal for them to drink with some high officials or even sleep with them.
stop talking to other people, just behave.
what should we do in the future? is it enough to be able to succeed alone? are we too faced with such hard choices?
more suffering is undisputedly disguised as glorious.
it's not so bad because they just play in their own circle, out of sight, out of mind.
but old zhang jizhong, who behaves like a hooligan in his circle and thinks he is virtuous without talent, made a tv series when he had nothing to do, to wreck the whole country's people.
both took what they needed.
when will china have a pure and innocent girl?
now the story is very shocking in the entertainment world, rumors are that hsu yuki was forced out because she refused to drink with guests arranged by the company, and had to switch to working as a lawyer's assistant to make an end meeting.
superstars often encounter social engagements or circumstances they are not welcome to but must join in.
they cann't decide on many things after all because it has to do with many aspects and the interests of many people.
sometimes, the dinner party that seems very normal to us, for a star, can be that simple that it is like we imagine.
stars have lots of contracts and if they tackle it well their sources of money will roll in, if not she will come to heel from the force or even the frame.
there are two kinds of star smart female: one holds a very high integrity, and sternly rejects all such invitations.
the second kind of person is good at playing tricks and achieving his objectives with his own seed money.
rumor has it that even some super star females have won their first roles this way.
after drinking some alcohol, the advertiser or sponsor of the show may have a chance to lie on the star's shoulder, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, and the star will most adopt an enduring attitude.
they are very low nine profession.
those stars are just pretending, actually they live a damn good life compared to this.
entertainers are just cheap people, there is somewhat of a sense of their reputation in feudal china.
agree.
oh well, the actors are not so easy to act.
they deserve it, they asked for it.
nothing is easy for me, dawn.

the international atomic energy agency has reached an agreement with iranian officials stating that there are no remaining issues or ambiguities regarding iran's nuclear program and activities.
u.s. and european officials suspect that iran's civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials suspect that iran's civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials may impose a fourth round of sanctions against tehran as the u.n. security council considers the issue of iran's nuclear energy program in september 2007.
the international atomic energy agency distributed limited copies of a publication copying iaea reports before a meeting of 35 board members on 070911.
the findings reflect iranian officials' public statements beginning the week of august 12, 2007 that iran had agreed to tehran on august 21, 2007.
according to the accord, the issue of iran's nuclear program and its activities will remain unresolved.
a reuters news account said the iaea report said the step was a significant forward step in the work plan.
a senior u.n. official was quoted by reuters as saying that iran's efforts to enrich uranium were slow.
the iaea report stated that iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of iran's present and future nuclear programs.
iranian officials stated on august 30, 2007 that iranian officials would cooperate with the iaea to prevent further rounds of international sanctions.
iran's representative to the iaea ali asghar soltanieh stated to the fars news agency in tehran that the report emphasizes that there are no signs or indications of diversion of iran's nuclear activities and that all of iran's nuclear material has been audited.
some non-proliferation experts stated that the iaea has ceded too much to iran.
in a criticism published 070819 week, institute for science and international security (isis) arms control expert david albright and isis arms control expert jacqueline shire wrote that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards and that the agreement does not specify that iranian officials will provide the iaea with access to key people and facilities and necessary documents.
independent experts stated that iran's agreement with the iaea to grant inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information was the latest shortcoming in iran's western demands to halt production of concentrated uranium which could be used for potential nuclear weapons.
u.s. state department spokesman tom casey stated that iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program but the report may offer some new details or insights into iran's development of the program.
casey stated that the nuclear program will continue to move forward, showing that the iranian regime will continue to defy the international community.
most western non-proliferation experts stated that the 070821 agreement contained little to dissuade policymakers in washington, london, paris and berlin from moving another round of security council sanctions forward.
experts stated that the issue of transparency had been previously resolved and that the issue had been resolved in agreement on august 21, 2007.
daryl g. kimball, executive director of the washington, d.c.-based arms control association, stated that the agreement addresses the problem of iran's pursuit of enrichment technology and capability which could lead to the production of nuclear material for a bomb.
kimball stated that the iranian government is designed to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim progress.
iranian officials stated that sanctions could be reduced if the inspectors collaborated.
the security council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on iran despite pressure from china and russia to limit the penalties to those demanded by the u.s.
in an interview with an iranian state-controlled television, soltanieh stated that the report and the measures made any other international organization irrelevant and unjustified for intervention.

the document outlines israel's proposal to allow international transfers of nuclear technology to states that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules and was distributed to the nuclear suppliers group.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india from nuclear trade restrictions.
israeli officials have convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing international transfers of nuclear technology to states that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
countries that are not signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (india, israel, pakistan) are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade, including purchasing reactors or uranium fuel or yellowcake.
in march 2007 a document outlining israel's proposals was distributed to 45 members of the nuclear suppliers group.
israeli presentations were made on a paper that did not allow for official denials.
the letter from the nsg chairman said that israel's presentation was offered on march 17, 2007 in the context of the nsg's debate over india's bid for exemption.
only india and israel among non-treaty signatories are qualified to admit their proposals to the nsg.
israel's plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-treaty states.
one criterion indicates israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and says that israel should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if it applies stringent physical protection, control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons, facilities and source materials in its territory, and to all special nuclear materials in its territory.
the document circulated in the capitol hill in september 2007 as the bush administration worked toward an agreement with indian officials.
arms control association executive director daryl kimball stated that the israeli document could affect the debate over india.
kimball stated --
at the nsg, officials from the countries that are the largest and most powerful want to be dynamic, not wanting obstacles to india and the united states.
reaching a consensus on india will be difficult at the nsg meeting in november 2007.
israeli proposals gave some officials reason to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
israel's record following international nuclear rules is good and better than india's.
the bush administration rejected israeli proposals despite israel's ties to the u.s. government.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india from nuclear trade sanctions.
president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice view the pact as an important part of the bush administration's foreign policy legacy.
the deal is controversial in india and must be approved by the us congress.
the delay in winning approval for the india deal could negatively affect the administration's foreign policy legacy with the election delay being the most negative.
state department spokesman tom casey stated that the u.s. government views the india deal as unique and does not see it as a precedent for any other country, including israel.
israeli embassy spokesman david siegel stated that the suggestion that israel's government is demanding exemptions or linking the effort to any other issue, including the indian debate, is grossly inaccurate.
seigel stated --
the israeli government has never asked the nsg for an exemption from the nsgs guidelines on nuclear supplies and has never made a specific request for israel.
israel recognizes the nsg guidelines in full fledge adherence.
the israeli government urged the nsg to consider adopting a generic multi-tiered approach to the transfer of nuclear technology based on criteria.
some nsg officials previously suggested an approach similar to israel's plan.
the non-nuclear proliferation regime would be considerably enhanced if the nsg guidelines were modified along the lines proposed by israeli officials.

ahmadinejad announced that iran has expanded its capability to produce uranium.
iran refuses to commit to a halt in expansion but hints that a halt may be possible in the future.
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashhad on july 26, 2008 that iran has expanded its arsenal of centrifuges to produce enriched uranium over 5000.
ahmadinejad stated that since the april 2008 announcement of iran's approach to implementing 6000 centrifuges, iran has made the first expansion.
iran has articulated a goal of 50,000 centrifuges operating at a plant near natanz.
the international community has demanded that iran halt nuclear material production.
the media reports differ from the number of centrifuges cited by ahmadinejad.
iranian news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated that iran has 6000 working centrifuges but subsequently removed the statement from the internet.
another iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100000 centrifuges.
experts discount the significance of ahmadinejad's claims because of the absence of information on the functionality of the centrifuges.
western diplomats speaking anonymously in tehran stated that the number of centrifuges is less important than the machine's operation and efficiency but that ahmadinejad's assertions hinder the resolution of the diplomatic standoff between iran and the west.
new america foundation arms control expert jeffrey g. lewis stated that the think tank is aware of iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but does not know the status of the machines' operational status.
diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems hinder iran's enrichment program.
iran repeated its assertion that its nuclear program is aimed only at producing electricity because it contradicts islamic principles.
the us, israel, europe and the majority of western arms control experts believe iran is pursuing the capability to produce a bomb immediately if it decides to do so.
experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple.
ahmadinejad stated that the west is still pursuing the resumption of negotiations after iran resisted western demands to halt iran's nuclear activities.
eu foreign policy chief javier solana recently presented iran with two offers.
a package of incentives to cease production of enriched uranium endorsed by the us.
for six weeks during the prenegotiations, iran was not adding centrifuges and the west refrained from promoting a fourth round of economic sanctions against iran at the un security council.
us officials repeated that negotiations cannot begin before iran halts all enrichment-related activities that can be verified, but the bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze and dispatched burns to geneva.
iran refused on july 26, 2008 in geneva talks attended by us undersecretary of state william j. burns to respond to the offer made by solana.
the talks constitute the highest level of diplomatic contact between the us and iran in nearly 30 years.
solana, burns and the european envoy set a deadline for iran's positive response before they initiated new sanctions that included a prohibition on selling iran refined petroleum products vital to iran's economy.
iranian officials refused to commit to stopping the expansion or observing deadlines.
20080726 ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that iran could potentially halt the expansion at a higher number of centrifuges than previously expected over a 6 week period.
ahmadinejad stated that the west consented to the existence and operation of 5000-6000 centrifuges if the number of centrifuges was not increased.
5000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if highly enriched.
6000 centrifuges running continuously could produce weapons-grade uranium for a single bomb in 6 months.
the international atomic energy agency stated in may 2008 that iran possessed 3500 operational centrifuges.

the paris diplomatic meeting concluded with no further agreement on taking steps to pressure iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility.
on november 14, 2008 a diplomat stated to the media that on november 13, 2008 in paris, the united states, european, russian and chinese officials had not reached an agreement to further act to persuade iran to halt uranium enrichment at its facility in natanz.
the highly technical process of uranium enrichment could produce fuel for nuclear power plants or fissile material for atomic weapons.
the 081113 meeting ended with no new measures announced.
the french foreign ministry released a statement on 13 november 2008 stating that after the 13 november 2008 meeting the statement declared that the international community reaffirmed that a dual-track approach to engaging iran diplomatically and working towards sanctions is important.
russia and china resisted new sanctions on iran.
russia and china are closely tied politically and economically with iran and do not feel domestic pressure to act against iran.
the united states is closely tied to the islamic republic of iran in politics and business and feels domestic pressure to act against iran.
russia and china hold veto power over security council decisions.
russian diplomat sergei ryabkov was quoted by interfax news agency in moscow as saying that at a meeting on november 13, 2008 russia will not strike a deal on iranian sanctions and western countries will favor the sanctions but china and russia will not support them.
sergei ryabkov attended the 081113 meeting.
a significant report on iran's progress with the heavy water reactor research facility near arak was released this week.
the iranian heavy water research reactor near arak may eventually be able to produce plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons.
images from a satellite published by the institute for science and international security show significant progress in the construction of the heavy water research reactor near arak from february 2008 to october 2008.
david albright stated that the heavy water reactor near arak, iran, for research purposes, has evaded notice from the international security community.
david albright stated that satellite images say that there has been significant progress at the iranian heavy water research reactor near arak and that the reactor has been under construction for the past 1.5 years in the form of a building frame for a large finished facility.
david albright was a former arms inspector and is the director of the washington, d.c.-based institute for science and international security.
iran stated that it is pursuing nuclear technology for energy production and research.
the united states and its western allies suspect that iran's nuclear production efforts preceded the creation of iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure.
under international arms control regulations, the production of low-grade uranium is legal.
iran's late development of nuclear technology shows the complex challenge that barack obama's incoming foreign policy team will face in taking on the task of stopping iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
in the last month in power, the george w. bush administration managed to synchronize u.s. policy with the leaders of the european union, great britain, france and germany to press for tougher sanctions against iran and diplomatic action.
the international atomic energy agency is expected to release a report next week criticizing iran.
the international atomic energy agency is a nuclear watchdog agency of the united nations.
the hope that another set of un security council sanctions would be imposed before the end of the bush presidency decreased because no new initiatives emerged regarding the iranian nuclear program at talks in paris on 13 november 2008.
iran continues to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology while maneuvering diplomatically.
some israeli officials stated that the iranian test of a solid-fuel rocket with a range of 1200 miles this week alarmed them.
tel aviv is less than 650 miles from iranian territory.

the russian laboratory complex with high security storage of anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria faced a loss of electricity because it lacked payment to the electricity utility mosenergo.
a large repository of anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria is threatened by a loss of electricity, stored in a highly secured russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of moscow.
a russian laboratory complex recently arrived officials from the moscow region's electricity utility mosenergo and threatened to turn off the electricity because of lack of payment.
the russian laboratory complex is a 90-building campus and served as the location of a secret biological weapons program during the soviet era.
the incorrect headline in izvestia stated that the virus was threatening the city.
the virus is at the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
every kind of bacterium studied for use in soviet union's secret biological weapons program is at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
there are large virus repositories in siberia.
russian and western officials stated that the power cutoff at the state scientific center of applied microbiology is unlikely to result in any public health threat.
russian and western officials stated that there was not enough certainty to know why power was lost at the state scientific center of applied microbiology, and that this could pose a threat to public health.
nikolai urakov, a general, said in a telephone interview that the state scientific center of applied microbiology has a system that could be quite reliable in an emergency.
nikolai urakov, a longtime director of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
western scientists work with the state scientific center of applied microbiology to convert the complex into a biomedicine manufacturing site.
nikolai urakov, a general, said in a telephone interview that the researchers were scared by this threat of sudden electricity shutdown, because of the kind of psychological pressure it puts on people.
nikolai urakov, a general, stated in a telephone conversation that scientists must destroy all ongoing bacteriological experiments if the power is shut down at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
general nikolai urakov stated that the united states and western countries have contributed another 5 million dollars a year to pay the electric bills and arrears of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
american scientists working closely with the state scientific center of applied microbiology stated that the russian government is responsible for paying the research institute's electric bills.
970000 peak of western aid to convert one bioweapons laboratory because it was learned that iran offered to purchase research experts from the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the crisis is being orchestrated by russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on western financing to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
american scientist randall lee beatty is working to convert the obolensk state scientific center of applied microbiology.
beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity at the state scientific and applied microbiology center is a crisis.
randall lee beatty is the director of the international science and technology center.
the international science and technology center financed approximately half of general nikolai urakov's budget to support about 350 russian biowarfare scientists and technicians.
randall lee beatty stated that the ssca m did not know that the ssca m's electricity bill had not been paid for 14 months.
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific and applied microbiology center is one of the most important locations in the world for archiving dangerous pathogens and is a shame to be destroyed because of non-payment of electricity bills.
approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the state scientific center of applied microbiology and many others are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment in all-layer enclosures and oversized air handling systems all dependent on electricity for function.
defrosting frozen live germs is the greatest danger from the shutdown of the electric power at the state scientific and applied microbiology center.
raymond zilinskas of the monterey institute of international studies, an expert on biological warfare, stated that the main threat is that the power of the state scientific center of applied microbiology has been cut instead of the threat of the possibility of the escape of the organisms.
raymond zilinskas stated that in the worst case, the bacteria would be defrosted at -70 degrees and that the cleanup afterward would be a real mess because it is not certain that all the bacteria would die.
another example is the electricity utility mosenergo confronting the obolensk state scientific center of applied microbiology, where the basic capitalist imperative of enterprise sustainability can be dangerously clashing with the old soviet science.
russian national power company cut off electricity at a strategic base where nuclear missiles stand at high alert because of an overdue power bill in 2000.
the silos for nuclear missiles will not lose power.
arm troops marched to the substation and turned the power back on.
united energy systems, a national company, cut power at a number of military installations around russia in january and february 2001.
the kamchatka peninsula is home to a monitoring center for the russian space forces and a lost power installation.
electricity was quickly restored in most cases of military installations that had been cut off.
investigations often show that the utility-military war tug forces the military to spend budget funds on electric power instead of diverting money to other useful things.
some budget funds are cut at times to build residences in the country for the general.

brazil has implemented a law allowing the air force to target aircraft trafficking drugs in brazilian airspace.
the us is concerned about liability if a civilian plane is misidentified.
brazil announced that the air force would begin shooting down aircraft used to traffic in illegal drugs in brazilian airspace.
the plan requires eight precautionary steps before an order to shoot down a plane can be issued.
prior to the policy taking effect in late october 2004, the publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they needed to file a fly plan.
the law permitting such actions was originally approved in 1998 but president fernando henrique cardoso never put the policy into effect.
the united states dissuaded cardoso from signing the decree because of the united states' concern that the accidental downing of a civilian aircraft could expose the government and companies to lawsuits.
in april 2001 the united states reduced its support for an operation targeting drug-running aircraft after a peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed a peruvian missionary and her child.
the relatives of the victims sued the us government and won a settlement from the us government for providing intelligence and technical support for the operation.
a us state department official stated --
us law may forbid assistance to countries implementing the shoot-down law, under certain conditions.
the us agrees with brazil's assessment that the threat from drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
the us government consulted the brazilian government on brazilian law provisions.
brazilian defense minister jose viegas stated that brazil has encountered difficulties in securing us support for the plan but that recent bilateral talks have led to a certainty that the brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing brazil to commercial sanctions.
brazilian officials expressed hope that the us would endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
the us has scheduled 102 million dollars in drug aid and law enforcement aid for brazil for 2004.
former air force chief and current director of the air institute of the estacio de sa university in rio de janeiro, general mauro jose miranda gandra stated that the government is taking a courageous step but the impact may be more political than practical because of the restrictions imposed by the brazilian government.
brazilian officials stated that the policy may not apply to aircraft with children on board.
viegas stated that there is a need for limits.
gandra stated that the provision undermines the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug smuggling aircraft that carry children, thus introducing the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
viegas stated in an interview in brasilia that the government would use the law more powerfully to dissuade drug traffickers from entering brazilian airspace feeling that the air force is not a threat.
the deteriorating public security situation in sao paolo and particularly rio de janeiro, where powerful and increasingly violent drug gangs are active, has prompted the government to act.
drug gangs in rio de janeiro have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close.
in a 2003 interview with a foreign correspondent president luiz inacio lula da silva stated --
national sovereignty and national security are policy matters.
some pilots of drug-running aircraft feel so confident of retribution that they give the brazilian air force pilots pursuing them obscene gestures.
under brazil's prohibition of the death penalty for criminal acts, is the constitution a law?
some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statutory amount was in fact a de facto death sentence for drug traffickers, contrary to the government's claims.
the o estado de sao paolo newspaper in a daily editorial stated that the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefits.
the application of extrajudicial penalties by administrative decision of the air force commander.
these people gained the power of life and death over the crew members and regular flyers.
brazil inaugurated the sivam radar system in 2002 at a cost of 1.4 billion dollars allowing the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive amazon region for the first time.
the system uses united states technology.
initially, illegal flights declined by 30 percent due to concerns about improved tracking of traffickers but subsequently reaccelerated.
brazil recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003.
some of these flights are innocently violating the ranchers who fly between plantations in the amazon.
viegas stated that deliberate violations of brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who appear to realize the government is incapable of retaliation have increased significantly.
in april 2001 fernandinho beira-mar, the most notorious drug boss in rio de janeiro, was captured in colombia on a drug pipeline involving left-wing guerrillas.
the northern amazon corridor of brazil has become a busy and increasingly essential route in the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
colombia reportedly runs a route across the northern tier of the amazon through suriname for the most important supply route for cocaine into europe.
colombia is the only country currently having a policy of targeting aircraft used in drug trafficking.
colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the united states.

international; weapons; leader; military
venezuelan president's dealings with russia over weapons, curbing military cooperation with the united states, and plans to train 2 million venezuelan civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion has worried venezuela and its domestic critics.
chavez's plans to deal with russia over weapons, curb military cooperation with russia, and plan to train 2 million civilians to repel a possible imperialist invasion have worried the united states and domestic critics of chavez.
chavez insisted that the move was purely defensive and that venezuela's overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect venezuela from any nation that might want to control venezuela.
venezuela is the petroleum-producing state in south america.
domestic opponents of chavez scoff at the idea of a us invasion of venezuela, charging that chavez's true intent is to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists to protect against any internal rise-up and to pose a militarized counterweight to us influence in latin america.
castro is a major ally of chavez and the two have grown closer.
detractors of chavez in the us government say that chavez's strategy of restructuring venezuelan democracy through an image of militarized socialism in the cuban style could even more troubled by the possibility of purchasing arms and indoctrinating civilians militias.
us strategists are increasingly concerned about the potential for such a revolution to be fomented by the radical moves inspired by chavez.
latin american politics have shifted leftward since the late 1990 s.
this large shift to the left is a reaction to the perceived failure of free market economics.
leftists elected to lead brazil, argentina, chile, uruguay, ecuador and venezuela.
chavez's supporters at home countered that the united states has a long history of open and covert armed intervention in the domestic politics of latin america and said that the united states has no right to question venezuela's preparations for defense.
carlos roque espinoza leon said venezuelans never ask what the us marines do.
venezuela's national assembly is served by pro-chavez espinoza leon who specializes in defense.
espinoza said peru has 500,000 rifles and no one is saying anything.
espinoza said no one complains that colombia is the most militarized country in latin america.
espinoza said the us history is full of aggression in latin america.
espinoza said venezuelans must do whatever is necessary to protect the country.
chavez said in his fame that the so-called venezuelan bolivarian revolution was a peaceful event but was armed.
chavez was first elected in 1998 and according to an independent poll by datanalisis, his popularity rating was 71 percent.
venezuelan military analyst alberto garrido said chavez is looking for allies in russia, china and iran to promote a multi-polar world that would counteract us dominance and encourage grass-roots movements in latin america to throw off us influence.
farmer lorenzo campos in the anzoategui state in northern venezuela and reservists were trained by him.
campos said venezuelans want the world to know that they are not preparing to attack anyone and that venezuela has a mission to protect.
in may 2005 the chavez government announced a deal with the russian firm to purchase 100,000 ak-103 assault rifles each with 30 rounds of ammunition for 18.6 million dollars and the transfer of technology to venezuela to manufacture the rifles.
the deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle.
this price is considerably less than the $ 825 - $ 850 price for the same weapon ordered through the us postal service.
the venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 russian helicopters, 10 spanish transport planes and 6 naval craft from russia.
venezuelan officials said the government is negotiating with brazil to buy around 24 air and train support planes.
chavez insists and even the staunchest military critics here agree that the purchase is essential to update old weapons like the fal, decades old from belgium.
retired general fernando ochoa antich said that the statement that chavez is engaged in an arms build-up is an exaggeration.
ochoa was defense minister in 1992 when chavez launched a failed coup.
ochoa stated that venezuela has not purchased arms in the past 25 years and that chavez has not bought weapons aggressively or in a threatening manner towards venezuela's neighbors.
ochoa said venezuela has never before bought arms from russia and suggested chavez bought arms to become independent of the us.
ochoa asked why chavez bought the popular caliber rifles in latin america and stated that his political support for radical leftist moves made him a continental menace.
the us pentagon is openly questioning what chavez is doing with the old fal rifles and whether he might share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in latin america.
the us government has provided no evidence that chavez is arming or funding a leftist insurgency.
military analysts and specialists said the rebels have plenty of money from drug trafficking to buy weapons and are not interested in old rifles from belgium or chavez's assistance.
a 2003 us defense intelligence agency study reported that more than half of the weapons seized from colombian guerrillas from 1998 to 2001 originated in venezuela.
implying that corrupt venezuelan military members or sympathizers could aid the guerrillas.
critics say the chavez-opposing domestic may be more distressed by the ideological military and civilian reservist training that chavez is saying is taking place.
chavez so called for the revolutionary units to start preparing the public for resistance to the superpower aggressor earlier in 2005 and said that the first step in resistance would be to train 1 million to 2 million volunteers in active duty armed forces in the coming year.
military analysts estimate venezuela's active duty armed forces number at 83000.
the people's defense units were created in neighborhoods, state companies and the chavez-established free university and report directly to the president.
the government insists that the reserve will support the armed forces and will not act against a possible coup against chavez.
espinoza said that reserves should not be used for troops shocking any political party and that each person would decide which side to be on in a civil war.
general julio ramon quintero viloria is the commander of the reserve.
in an interview quintero said that the armed forces hope to train 50000 civilians over 20 weekends in 2005 and that 300000 more civilians could be trained in 2006.
quintero said venezuelans do not want any empire's colony and are ready for any possibility.
in june 2005, 100,000 reservists and the venezuelan navy engaged in a massive war game to repel a stronger invader.
in june 2005, 40 state oil company employees participated in a similar exercise with 1,200 soldiers.
here is a chavez-favoring circle warning of asymmetrical warfare.
asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by us strategic military personnel to describe conflicts between unequal combatants in which the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
the us government has given colombia 3.3 billion dollars in military aid over the past five years.
chavez loyalists fear that the us government may instigate a proxy war between colombia and venezuela in order to oust chavez and control venezuelan oil.
in an interview, a senior us official dismissed the notion that the us government wants to invade venezuela as utterly completely nonsensical.
officials said the chavez side wishes to make a negative relationship because chavez politically calculates that he will reach power by constantly confronting the us.
another development that troubles the united states is the rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises by chavez.
the us military has had a cooperation office in venezuela for 50 years.
chavez shut it down in 2004.
5 us military trainees and students will leave the country in april 2005.
analysts say chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
analysts say that chavez's use of that force to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere is unproven.

the north korean government is preparing to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in june 2007 in the first step toward disabling the reactor by december 2007.
on june 18, 2007, christopher hill, the u.s. assistant secretary of state, stated that the north korean government could be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor by the first step by december 2007.
hill is the head of the united states negotiating team for the north korean nuclear weapons program.
hill stated that stalled efforts to dismantle north korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the international atomic energy agency inspectors visit pyongyang at the invitation of pyongyang officials from 16 june 2007 to 17 june 2007 to talk about verification and monitoring of the shutdown.
hill stated that the shutdown is anticipated to be long following talks with chinese negotiator wu dawei.
hill stated that it is possible to shut down in a week but not in a month.
the associated press reported on 18 june 2007 from vienna, austria that the iaea stated that a team visited pyongyang on 24 june 2007 to discuss the manner of inspectors' verification of the shutdown.
hill stated that iaea inspectors held talks with pyongyang officials regarding the reactor's seal, including the installation of television monitoring sites.
north korean officials refused to proceed with an agreement to begin decommissioning yongbyon until 25 million dollars in funds were transferred to a linked account held in macao's banks.
money was frozen when united states officials accused banco delta asia of complicity in north korean financial crimes.
the fund was wired to the new york federal reserve bank on june 14, 2007, after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds.
the fund is supposed to be sent to the russian central bank before the transfer to the north korean government's account at a russian commercial bank.
hill stated that talks were taking place with russian, south korean and japanese disarmament negotiators on 17 june 2007 to recoup time lost in organizing financial transfers.
the discussions also involve setting a timetable for the resumption of six-nation talks on arms control.
in exchange for the 50000 tons of fuel oil, north korean officials pledged to shut down yongbyon and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown.
in the next phase of the agreement, north korean officials declared an all-nuclear program and disabled all facilities in return for further 9.5 million tons of fuel oil.
hill stated that the technical conclusion could be made by december 2007 regarding the next phase of the agreement.

a list from the nuclear suppliers group shows that iran has been denied the purchase of nuclear-related materials approximately 75 times since 1998 due to suspicions that the purchases could be used to build a bomb.
the nuclear suppliers group, an offshoot of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, is a 45-nation organization charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes does not go to military use.
the nuclear suppliers group is composed of advanced technology countries.
the nuclear suppliers group's mission statement says that countries will act on an individual basis to block trade that violates export controls devised to maintain international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
the nuclear suppliers group has no enforcement powers beyond notifying companies of violations of its guidelines.
the nuclear suppliers group keeps data private and meets in large secrecy.
most of the denials have been since 2002 and have resulted in intervention by the member countries of the nuclear suppliers group.
the list of denials includes trade availability to diplomats from countries of interest in exposing the extent of iran's efforts to acquire so-called dual-use items that could be converted into weapons production.
the list is available, provided that the diplomat and his country are not identified.
the list includes australian, finnish, swedish and united arab emirates companies prevented from carrying out deals because of suspicions that the items sold were of military use.
the items on the list offered for sale in a block deal include nickel powder, petrochemical plant components, compressors, furnaces, steel flanges and fittings, electron microscopes, radiometric ore sorting machines, valves and tubing, lasers, rotary drilling rigs, mass spectrometers, nitrogen production plants.

xp stated on the defaced website that any website containing material contrary to sunni teachings will be hacked.
the official website of iraq's leading shiite religious leader grand ayatollah ali al-sistani was defaced and blocked in a cyber attack motivated by sectarianism.
it is not clear when the attacks began, on september 18 or 19 morning?
al-sistani's website was offline on the evening of september 19, 2008.
another website related to one of al-sistani's religious organizations, www.al-shia.com, was also affected.
the alternative address www.sistani.com is still operational.
iran's fars news agency stated that xp has blocked access to approximately 300 shiite-related sites from 080918 to 080919.
the claims of a hack and iran's assertions that the xp group is based in the united arab emirates cannot be independently verified.
several iranian news sites stated on september 19, 2008 that many of the iranian shiite-related websites were again running normally.
a statement signed by the xp group was posted on al-sistani's home page of his web site and stated that the attack was on behalf of the sunni muslims.

somali pirates who hijacked a ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms approached a deal for the ship's release.
questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms through the route to kenya and the possible clandestine arms deals with south sudan.
on october 8, 2008 maritime officials and associates of the somali pirates who hijacked the ukrainian freighter carrying large cargo of arms on september 25, 2008 stated that the pirates could collect their ransom soon.
after difficult negotiations involving several people involved in a bazaar-style haggling, the parties were close to reaching a deal that would pay pirates millions of dollars and free the ship.
ahmed omar, a businessman in xarardheere, somalia, stated that pirates had agreed to a ransom of approximately 8 million u.s. dollars from the ship's owners and that the ship could be freed on october 8 or 9, 2008.
xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the somali coast.
kenyan maritime officials stated that there is yet to be an agreement on critical details.
in one such detail, pirates have requested a guarantee that the current armada of united states warships encircling pirates will not arrest or attack pirates.
a kenyan maritime official stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than financial aspects.
officials stated on october 8, 2008 that progress was made and that the parties had an agreed approach.
the pirates initially requested 35 million u.s. dollars and then reduced it to 20 million u.s. dollars.
the pirates have consistently expressed a willingness to negotiate on financial figures.
more than 25 ships were hijacked off the coast of somalia in 2008, typically ransomed for between $ 1 and $ 200,000 u.s. dollars.
ukrainian pirates stated that the ship and its cargo and the 20 sailors on board would be released upon receipt of a us $ 100,000 payment.
the original destination country of the arms shipments that boarded ukrainian ships is --?
the kenyan government claimed that the weapons were on board a ship shortly after the freighter was hijacked on september 25, 2008.
ships through the main kenyan port of mombasa.
the weapons on board include 33 t-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
subsequently, evidence emerged of weapons deals between kenya and the clandestine arms networks in southern sudanese separatist regions.
if the pirates did not hijack the ship and did not begin speaking to the media via satellite phone, the deal is most likely to remain secret.
ukrainian officials are adamant in denying any wrongdoing.
ukrainian diplomat oleh belokolos in kenya stated --
ukraine has no supplies of any armaments to the government of south sudan and has no plans to do so.
all appropriate paperwork was validated.
ukraine will abide by all united nations rules and agreements on arms control.
ukraine inherited an enormous stockpile of weaponry after the collapse of the soviet union and now deals in major arms.
kenya is suspicious of ukraine's dealings because kenya relies most on the united kingdom and other western countries for heavy weapons supplies.
kenyan politicians have demanded answers and called for several commissions to examine the situation.
southern sudan is an autonomous region that currently has increased military and uses soviet-designed tanks.
the united states military stated that it would prioritize ensuring that the shipment of weapons would not be unloaded and sold to islamist insurgents in somalia.
pirates deny any interest in weapons and claim not to realize tanks were included in the cargo when they hijacked the ship.
pirate spokesman sugule ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates are only interested in money in the deal.

u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said afghanistan produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban cut back poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support the price and preserve a major source of insurgency financing.
u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said afghanistan produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support the price and preserve a major source of insurgency financing.
costa said this to reporters last week as the u.n. drug office prepared to release its latest survey of afghanistan's opium crops.
the survey showed that poppy cultivation has retreated much in afghanistan and is overwhelmingly concentrated in the 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, most of which are in the southern provinces.
the survey was issued on 27 november 2008.
the united nations found that the amount of land devoted to opium in afghanistan was reduced by 19 percent, although total production of opium dropped by just 6 percent.
the study stated that high output rates are attributed to good growing seasons in the southern states.
the south is heavily irrigated area where the taliban maintains a strong presence in 5 provinces and has systematically encouraged opium cultivation to finance its insurgency for several years.
the u.n. estimates that insurgents made much more than $ 300 million from opium trading last year.
costa said that the effort could be funded with dollars between 200 million and 3 billion.
the taliban produced an amount of opium far in excess of world demand over three successive bumper crop years.
costa said the result would be a glut that would depress prices that have dropped approximately 20 percent.
costa said there is already evidence that the taliban, drug lords and some farmers have stockpiled opium.
there is also an increased process in afghanistan.
costa added that insurgents hold a significant amount of opium.
costa said the surplus was as much as 11000 tons (2.2 times the world's demand over the past 3 years) and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
the united nations found that afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008.
the world's demand is estimated at about 4400 tons per year.
the taliban stood passively by this year while the cultivation took place and pressured afghan farmers less to plant opium poppies.
then this supports the current price.
costa is an italian diplomat who has served with the u.n. office on drugs and crime for six years.

the government of south africa imposed a ban on recruitment of people from within south africa or outside south africa as mercenaries or assisting foreign military.
the citizen newspaper stated on 06 october 2001 that it is illegal for south africans to be involved in mercenary activities within or outside the country.
the citizen newspaper stated that the south african foreign ministry announced on 05 october 2001 that the south african government had imposed a ban on mercenary activities following reports that 1000 muslims trained in military enlistment were to leave south africa to fight for the taliban in afghanistan against the united states.
the report claims that the muslims against illegitimate leaders (maill) organization claims that 1,000 muslim men with military training have volunteered to serve and will receive backing from local businessmen.
the report claimed that 1,000 muslim men all with military training were over the age of 18.
the muslims against illegitimate leaders (maisl) is a cape town-based group.
the muslim judicial council refuted the report.
the south african foreign ministry stated that south africa's foreign military assistance act prohibits recruitment of people from within or outside the country as mercenaries or as foreign military assistance.
the south african foreign military assistance act means that no person may offer military assistance to any state, state organ, group or other country unless the national conventional arms control committee grants permission.

hong kong, china
technology and international
hong kong universities are collaborating with mainland universities, businesses and mainland government sectors to coordinate training programs and research centers to promote the commercialization and transfer of high-tech research.
in 2004, hong kong's tertiary institutes contributed to improving hong kong's relations with the mainland of china in terms of high technology research and development, as an activity.
the hong kong university collaborates with the tertiary education, business and government sectors of mainland china to direct training programs and research centers to promote research commercialization and technology transfer.
in june 2004, hong kong polytechnic university joined the hong kong - shenzhen science and technology university park of the virtual university park in shenzhen, china, becoming the first tertiary institute in hong kong to establish research centers and training facilities on the mainland.
polyu president poon chung-kwong stated that the public and private sectors in hong kong will strengthen their connections with the mainland in various areas.
poon stated that hong kong's cooperation with china will facilitate the university's more effective promotion of technology transfer and human resource development in the mainland, creating positive results for hong kong and china.
in june, city university of hong kong signed an agreement with the university of science and technology of china in anhui province to establish a joint high-level research center in suzhou.
the chinese academy of sciences established the university of science and technology of china.
the agreement is based on the principle of mutually beneficial collaboration to complement each other's strengths to work together on joint research projects, supervision of research students, teaching and administration of professional training opportunities.
in addition to joining a large-scale high-tech exchange program in the mainland of china, hong kong university also partners with educational institutes to enhance communication between the mainland and hong kong in disciplines.
hong kong university of science and technology (hkust) demonstrated its latest achievements in research and development at the 6 th annual china hi-tech fair held in shenzhen in october 2004.
hkust demonstrated more than 30 new technologies and new products covering a wide range of technologies including nanotechnology, multimedia, logistics, radio frequency identification technology, advanced manufacturing and biotechnology.
hkust is also collaborating with a prominent mainland manufacturer to develop high-capacity lithium batteries based on nanomaterials.
this is the latest in a series of technology transfer agreements reached by hkust and successfully collaborated on.
hkust president paul ching-wu chu stated --
hkust increases funding for research into new technologies required by the pearl river delta industry.
the university will continue to leverage its extensive relations with international research institutions and multinational corporations to enhance the development of advanced technologies with immediate and practical applications in china.
i am 24 and my mother is 2.5.
i have been broken up with my son's father since august.
i want to start dating other people and my father said nothing to do with him.
he is very possessive and controlling but he doesn't have the right to be because we are together.
right now, he's going on too much in his life, and i've told him several times that i don't love him and he doesn't love me.
i want him to be there for his son, not me too.
but he has no one, his family don't get along with him and they have issues.
i don't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he's around the more miserable i am.
i don't want him to be there for his son because he is a good father or at least trying to be.
i believe every child needs both parents, whether together or not.
but he thinks if no one can have me, then no one will.
what do i do for a living?
it's very bad to be threatened by your ex using your son.
you have to give in to that or it just escalates.
you have the right to live your life and be happy, so don't cave in to his threats.
he would see the person regardless if he really loved his son, but this is just a typical method of control used by people like him.
other people say things like " if you leave me, i'll kill myself "... does it get through to you?
when is your date?
meet all kinds of people.
do what you want.
you'd be better off without him if the price was that he walked out of your life voluntarily.
i agree, one other thing, his business is not your date or not your date.
i didn't tell him.
he didn't threaten you, he didn't care about your personal life.
can you document his threats?
you really need this.
quit taking his calls and make him leave voice mail.
make him email or text you.
keep that record.
get a lawyer and divorce.
if you cann't afford one, try legal aid.
tell your ex-significant other that all communication needs to go through a lawyer.
the bus driver, the people till, and the people who deliver your food want the exact change.
don't they realize that you don't get a pile of change from the bank?
someone has to take notes somewhere?
people are getting lazy.
i'd like to be as near as possible, because i don't like counting copper all day.
if you take a twenty pound note on the bus, they'll just tell you to get on the bus, because they're hell of a lazy.
it is illegal to pay a certain amount in a load of coins (e.g. you can only pay 30 pence in 1 pence coins).
hello, i started uni in september but obviously didn't gel with it immediately like most people.
i know it will take some time for me to adjust, though, since i'm very introverted, shy, especially anxious, and all the rest.
on my first night here, i went out with all my housemates and it was the hardest thing i've ever had to do.
i went to a student union bar by myself when i was sober.
here's the point, though:
i didn't enjoy university after being here for about 5 months, the course disillusioned me, i didn't enjoy the set projects and didn't like the course delivery much.
the university made out much better than it seemed.
i started badly with the first term, and the finances of students are delayed and added to my stress levels, so i'm so worried i cann't progress with my work, so it's all piled up.
i was assigned a counselor at the university, saw him in a block session, and honestly, it didn't really work out because i never opened up to him.
only half a heart.
i'm loaded with work to my neck, have to hit major deadlines, depressed and the anxiety results in feeling miserable all the time.
i no longer have a counselor because you can only have one at a time and i doubt it will help me much this time if it hasn't already.
i lack motivation, i don't feel comfortable with the lecturers, i feel like i want to give in but i cann't because i'll end up with a dead end job and aspire to be someone.
i'd rather die than be uneducated and not live the life i want to live, and by dropping out of university i've made matters worse.
i am 21 years old, turning 22 this year, i don't have much time to fail, i have to do something.
i failed college once and did another course so i could get into university.
can someone please advise me?
maybe you can go see your doctor and see if there is a way you can extend your deadline to try and ease the pressure a bit.
send an email like this to your tutor, they will consider the mitigating circumstances, don't worry, they've seen all sorts of admissions statements before. i know, i used to work in the university administration department.
break your work into manageable chunks.
concentrate on one bit of work at a time, the most urgent assignment, obviously.
don't shut off your housemate, do well because you are trying something new from the very beginning, keep it now.
i would recommend you go see your doctor too.
if you're always an anxious person, speaking to someone might benefit you. my friend got therapy from the nhs because of anxiety, it's really normal.
try to get an extension, if you're honest i'm sure your uni will allow it.
it's hard to keep strong and keep on living.
my mum divorced, she had a horrible time with my stepfather and she was sent off to find her freedom and she was sent round the bend.
she has epilepsy and is manically depressed with huge anger problems.
she is constantly horrible to me.
i cann't cope with her outbursts and the nasty, hateful things she says at home.
i'm 18 years old and i have a 95 % bursary studying full time at a private school with high pressure in 6 th form at the point of my break.
i cann't work from home because she shouts at me.
so i was angry with my teachers then.
she was lovely in the first minute, like i had my mummy back, then she turned into the most spiteful human being alive in the next.
i didn't pass my a2 exams and i've already accepted that i've been defeated and this year of my life is going to make me fail.
i don't know if i can come back to this, but the university has offered me the most amazing offer, but i cann't even accept it. i've never made a grade in my life.
i wish i could wipe her out from my life, things would be so much better without her.
but then i think i'm just selfish.
but surely this is not how i want to live, is it?
it's so much better!
but i feel like i'm powerless to this downhill spiral.
and i don't know what to do.
thanks for reading.
nice vent.
you cann't get her sectioned for that.
even does she have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis?
you sure don't know you won't get a good grade so you accept a place if possible.
life throws things at you all the time.
if you are not someone in your family, then you are an outsider.
i had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for 8 years before coming to university, and i'm honestly here for the only reason it's the only way out.
if you really want out, work hard.
really, if she cann't give you consistent support, you need it from somewhere else.
can you call childline or something similar?
you can go to the library on saturday and study for 8 good hours.
can you go to your friend's house to form a study group?
she's the section that's a bit painful and you blame her for all your problems, so you want to section her?
i know how you feel.
my mum spits hell too.
i would highly recommend taking up smoking.
oh, tsr grew up and stopped nagging, it's a joke.
i think i became much weaker person in the past 2 years, and in the way of trying to befriend some people at university, i dulled down my personality.
but when people are overly nice to you, they lead you to believe that you can say whatever you want, hell, or do whatever you want.
they showed absolutely no respect.
for example, i say hello to someone from the university, and they ignore me, but 30 minutes later they decide they want my help with some work and i give it to them.
it's caused a lot of anger and distress in my life and it's really starting to affect my concentration at uni.
has anyone got any experience of handling things of this sort or how to go about getting some respect again?
just say no.
if it doesn't particularly make you comfortable, do it gradually.
you could start with " sorry i'm not but i'm busy "
of course you wouldn't go over the top with it, you wouldn't go in the completely opposite direction.
if you think about it, no.
they start respecting you more when they start realizing you won't bend backwards over for them.
this is really such a bad attitude well you can be respected of course if you are not a nice person but let them do anything to you then you are a fool.
i don't know if anyone will read this but i just feel despair and i need to tell someone.
i left home in september and started university, i am incredibly anxious about doing this but i've been delaying thinking about it until i get here, i'm here now and will be here for over two weeks, i feel overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and awkward socially.
since moving to secondary school i have had two periods of counselling (roughly 15 months) and i have struggled emotionally throughout the majority of my life, losing my dad around the age of 9 and always blaming it on how i felt.
i feel like i'm having a moment where i feel overwhelmed by the problems in my life that are credibly unbelievable and i'm making myself doubt my self esteem that's always been low. i cann't concentrate on work, i often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions and i doubt myself about anything and everything.
my two counselors did not diagnose me with depression and suggested i was not suffering from depression, but i was and am huge worried about depression because my dad died of depression and suicide.
i tried to solve my problems before, found particular usefulness in exercises and meditation, also tried things like self-help books and tapes, but generally speaking i feel this is my life, this is one chance i have to exist, this is one chance i have to be a young man. so i'm wasting one chance i have to exist, one chance i have to be a young man. i'm beating this feeling away.
i simply don't know what to do, i never follow through on what i think i should do, my friends often say i'm lazy, and i cann't disagree a lot of the time, i feel like people are trying to do everything they can to help me, and i fail again and again and again.
sorry to anyone who has read this jumbled mess, but i feel a bit like a self-seeking moaner, but i'm truly desperate.
as people are in new situations and feel pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into new roles (e.g. university student), common is for people to become more intensely aware of their own existence and feelings towards others.
i am not a health professional, i can only speak from my own personal experience, so i would strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional for your depression feelings and worries.
feel most people feel awkward and unintelligent when they first get to university, so you're not alone there. i would really recommend you get some counselling services appointment at your university, but really, it doesn't matter what anyone tells you, you're having some problems, and you might have some support. you're having a minute of some problems, and you might have some support. labels are not as important as the experience, and it's not as important as the experience. meditation and exercise are really helpful, so try to do that. you have to engage with help and general life to get somewhere, but don't beat yourself up if you feel unmotivated to do anything at the minute. a lot of people feel like this, and hopefully it will pass when you start to feel better. you're not the only one, and you're not kind to yourself, only worse. kind to yourself, and get some help.
good luck!
i think a lot of people feel the same way you do, but they medicate themselves by using their friends, i don't think that's the solution, but being around your friends when you're depressed is definitely better than being alone and depressed, either way if you fancy a chat you can message me privately.
if you are me, i focus on idols. you aspire to be someone who comes from a bad background and ends up succeeding, happy, having a family, married, etc. not you yourself.
you focus on what you have achieved in life, you don't state what you studied or why you studied it, you want the experience, your mum wants you to go, you need a degree for the career you want.
so either way, you sum up why you're there, and work your butt off to get the best grade you can, because when you get your degree, you'll have something to say like " hey, i didn't fail, i worked hard and passed."
x.
i hope this helps.
i'm pretty much not autistic, i think the doctor misdiagnosed me, but i walk on my toes nearly all the time.
it's more comfortable for me.
how did they make the decision that walking on toes is an autism sign when it seems so random and not always indicative?
well, i can have things that signal something on the autism spectrum, but how many?
you guys know what i mean.
walking on toes is a symptom of autism.
headaches can be a symptom of a brain tumor.
feeling tired a lot could be a symptom of leukaemia.
symptoms are never always applied but are worth noting if they occur a lot of times in a lot of cases, as in this instance it is clearly inferred.
i walk on my toes, but it's because i have strange under-curled toes that had to be surgically straightened two years ago.
my brother is autistic, but i didn't notice it either, the spectrum is so broad, and i probably have a mild case of asperger's, which would explain why i have problems with communication and don't pick up on social/body language.
then i don't have the proper diagnosis and you might even have some symptoms which don't necessarily mean you have a certain condition.
i don't walk on my toes because i was told not to for years.
i have dyspraxia.
so you might be dyspraxic or have short tendons.
i've drilled it myself for the dance/gymnastics/ballet etc.
i've read too much about random symptoms like that.
hello, i'm a 12 year old girl addicted to self harm.
i started slitting my fingers with scissors at the age of 7 and never stopped from that day on.
it's gotten worse because i have a scar on my leg from when i slit it open stapling for my ex-boyfriend's name because i wouldn't stop cutting when i was bleeding.
i have several slits in my arms.
they healed and i then cut myself with staples and razors.
i took around 5 paracetamols and other drugs with lager and vodka when there was no way of finding a cutter.
i'm really tempted to cut my arms or burn myself to death while writing this.
i'm an addict, i'll cut again when one heals.
i think about it every day.
i'm 12 and my life is already sickening me.
this is from a source who left me at 7 years old and didn't want to know me anymore.
he just cares about his little new girlfriend and his wife and his new life that i don't want.
my best mate died when i was 10 years old.
i'm in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and i'm forbidden to speak to him because of the events and the age difference.
my mum also suffers from bipolar and i have depression.
i don't want to stop.
i don't care what i do, i want to do it over and over again to torture myself, i hate myself.
but i love my best mate to death, he means the world to me and if he did anything i would do anything.
i didn't tell him, but he found out.
i don't want to hurt him, he doesn't want to hurt himself.
what do i do?
thanks for reading.
are you on any drugs or do drugs get any therapy?
talk to your school nurse or your general practitioner and tell them what's going on.
maybe your trusted teacher can tell you.
if you tell people, they can help you.
if you keep it bottled up inside, it's only going to get worse.
trust me, it's better to get this thing as early as possible rather than let it get even worse.
please don't do this.
i'm 17 and started self harming (mainly cutting my arms) last year but stopped a few months ago.
it's hard but you can do it.
i feel so much happier but seeing the scars painfully reminds me of how i felt at that time and how strong those feelings were that i wanted to do such things to myself.
it's also strong, you can do it, i found salvation through writing poetry and keeping a journal.
self harm is addictive but you can overcome it.
remember, self harm is not a defining characteristic of who you are.
you can overcome it.
so i thought i was getting a form of ocd because i found myself always checking my belongings to ensure i didn't lose or leave anything behind when i go out especially to university.
i have to check every 2 goes, and then i cann't resist checking again after 30 seconds for some reason.
why is this?
am i crazy or something?
it is often carried by many things that it rarely carries, and is even still checked on a daily basis. is this any extent of ocd?
what can i do about this?
if i don't check, i get very anxious that sort of goes away after 15-30 minutes, but often i get anxiety that i cann't wait that long.
i feel doomed if i lose my wallet or phone.
i just wish i could go out without worrying about leaving something or losing something every 2 minutes.
i really don't know what to do and i'm afraid to go to a general practitioner.
they probably never heard of some compulsion like this and i just don't know what to do.
do any of you have a similar ritual?
people think i'm crazy but it's very strange how you get yourself out of this.
what advice can you give me?
i used to do this on the way to college, had a list of items i knew i had and used to check compulsively on the bus.
i have more severe anxiety now and think this is a warning sign, so just try to wean yourself off the habit when it's relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor, but also don't tell yourself to keep checking these things out.
don't worry about that, the doctor saw a much worse case.
i did a class on ocd today in psychology.
just avoid compulsive action, so you don't check that you've lost something and leave it at that.
your anxiety levels will increase over time, but hopefully your ocd will gradually decrease.
that just sounds like you're anxious over something instead of having a really bad ocd.
i am very obsessed with getting up at 20 to 1 am to check all the locks on my house particularly.
sometimes i am convinced they are not locked, even though i know they are.
i think it becomes a real problem when the obsessive interruption of your daily routine really starts.
you definitely aren't crazy so don't worry about it and i'm sure your gp will understand the issue.
i'm going for therapy for other reasons also, they encourage me to pick a number less than 20 and stick to it and cut down.
i think the idea is to teach me, and if i check in 5 times or 20 times, i'm still ok.
so far i'm a lot better, and i definitely think anyone who wants to improve can.
i'm usually pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and not worry too much about them.
but i found myself becoming really anxious about the thing over the past month or two and i'm not talking about mere nervousness from the blue.
i began to feel panicky for no rational reason about a variety of things that i didn't worry about too much beforehand, even crossing my mind as something that would ring alarm bells in my head.
i'm not sure if this is the cause of this or if it's a sign of other issues, but this is beginning to bug me because it affects my confidence and happiness.
i spoke it to a few people, including my parents, but all think i'm going through random phases and should hold off on acting until the serious problems are cleared up.
so what is the best thing to do?
you speak to a doctor and see if there is an edge taking off an anxiety pill from the thing.
can i see a counselor?
or should i take the advice of the people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem?
well, i wouldn't start trying to eye your anxiety, it'll make me tense and more likely to panic, there's a circle of death there.
i would recommend that you try to focus on something that will guarantee you a smile or a feeling of being happier as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky.
or if you cann't do that, get your friends to make you laugh when you start to feel panicky, it works for me and i laugh loudly at the random panic attacks.
i just started to worry about tiny things really, but not as severe as you sound.
i find just talking to someone else about the things that make you anxious helps.
i found it a perhaps not so moaning way to find that i was able to mention my worries to my mum and see her react to the situation in a calm way as i had recommended, which made me feel better about the thing, knowing that it was a not so big deal and i didn't need to be anxious about it.
but if it worsens, go to the doctor.
i have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety which can prevent him from leaving the house and doing things because he is so worried about what might go wrong.
the doctor gave her medication and it made her much better.

it won't take long.
route 288, a circumferential highway that runs around the southwest quadrant of the richmond-new urban region, opened in late 2004.
it has already changed the developmental pattern and caused localized traffic congestion around its exits.
the richmond times dispatch today told the tale of the impact of the huguenot trail in powhatan county.
will jones reported that traffic on one section of huguenot trail has more than doubled since the opening of 288.
speeding and accidents are surging as well.
so far this year, 17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of winterfield road, up from 12 all of 2004.
virginia department of transportation resident engineer dale totten notes that if vdot had more money, they could add four lanes to the road at a cost of about $ 13 million.
of course vdot has no money to construct roads in the richmond region.
because vdot spent all their frigging money on 288 because of local politicians and boosters.
where is homer simpson when you need him?
doh, this is a major moment!
we predict that route 288 will generate residential development in the area around all of the exits, which is a scarce populated area, overtaxing a local country road.
other people choose where they work and where they live, but limited access highways can relieve traffic for drivers who back and forth between chesterfield and goochland counties.
and they create traffic congestion in new places.
i am surprised at how rapid this is only.
i even think it could be 3 or 4 years.
think about it, route 288 already created this road at a cost of $ 130 million just at this one exit.
another predictable thing.
road improvement needs soared after a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of a megaproject at the intersection of 288 and a major road.
well, we may see liability zoom past the original $ 400 million taken to build the original highway by the end of the decade.
the idea is to say to the brainiac who thought such a great idea was route 288.
thanks for nothing.
i think we could spend $ 4 billion elsewhere better.
i think you shouldn't blame 288 for creating those people.
what if they are enough to create new traffic congestion in a new place?
will additional traffic congestion occur in the old place?
now you understand how tmt in fairfax feels.
i usually take a pro-road position.
288 is definitely excessive, but there are glaring needs in other parts of the state.
richmond has virtually no traffic.
lasted 30 minutes during rush hour.
and give them a beltway through a large rural area.
road to nowhere
just think, this money could be spent on another potomac river crossing or on desperately needed road improvements in nova.
insult said to virginia centrists that the state's contribution to the 288 budget deal last year added insult to injury in wiping out the debt.
very nice of you all to oblige us.
but not much sense.
the same problem, old.
if you get ahead of the need, you are the cause of sprawl.
if you build in places that are already acutely in need, you cann't pave your way out of congestion.
anonymous
that's a fair point.
5:26 makes a good point.
but this situation hammers home the validity of the reports of the state auditors who found that ctb and vdot funds were being used to fund transportation projects based on the best lobbying, instead of being based on a comprehensive state transportation plan.
i submit this is a situation that is unacceptable and a disgrace.
and senator chichester and his toadies pour more money into this flawed institution, making it worse.
what is the purpose of transportation expenditures?
in virginia it is for the benefit of private business plans, not for the public interest.
you're all dead wrong.
walter stoch stated that the money was intended to pay for roads for economic development on 288.
come on folk.
tmt, i don't understand your point.
how long have you been stuck in traffic last time you weren't destined for or from some sort of business?
it seems to me that the whole purpose of the roads is to facilitate the public's interest in getting into and from private business.
there is overwhelming support for business, but it's sunday, a grandmother's trip, and of course a soccer game.
we don't wonder why we suffer from congestion problems because our expenditures on roads don't match the increase in business or state domestic products.
if we recognize that the primary benefit of roads is to business, then we should do two things.
businesses will pay more for the things they pass on to us, and we will incentivize businesses to locate where they will stress the system the least, even if that means more overall travel.
why is it so hard to understand?
the solution is to solve the functional pattern of human settlement and the balance between the capacity of the transport system and the travel demand generated by land use.
all else is spin.
emr
in virginia, tmt said it was for the benefit of private business plans and not to serve the public interest.
i don't see the point of this statement as it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else.
i think they are intertwined so tightly that they are virtually the same.
the problem is local because this cookie dough is lumpy.
however, in the long run, if we demonize business long enough, we will eventually find ourselves all working for the devil.
i don't see the point in claiming to have solved the dynamic balance of a nature that is ever changing.
even you see the positive of the rail to dulles because it is a job center that will promote the bidirectional demand for rail.
i agree.
in fact, that is all the reason that is necessary, in itself.
all i'm saying is that the same logic should be applied to roads.
they should have a destination at both ends so we can use our investment to the maximum.
we need more places to get closer to the balance you say we need.
here's the reality check.
i drive past watkins landing every morning and evening.
i commute back and forth to my work location on huguenot trail.
i never saw anything remotely like a traffic flood.
it's a 55 mph zone where cars are going 75-100 mph in the morning.
huguenot trail is already in the plans to be widened because of heavy demand from development in chesterfield, a new school, and a whole bunch of existing development that has been zoned for years along robious road.
288 is wonderful for those of us who actually use it instead of the bottleneck that powhatan and western chesterfield are.
we can develop commercially and work closer to our lives.
you might think that's irrational use of land.
i don't desire to live in any city.
i refuse to work in the downtown area.
i refuse to use mass transit that is unsafe for female commuters who work long hours and irregular hours.
and i like the idea of a lot of development happening.
i don't understand exactly how i'm supposed to keep a horse on a quarter acre lot.
one gallon of gas could go for $ 10.
and i still pay to live in the country.
many people legitimately prefer horses, hunting, gardening, and certain small businesses over living in the urban core.
this infatuation with city living truly baffles me.
anonymous 6:37, if you wish to live in the country, you have every right to do so.
you are not right that the rest of the state should underwrite a 4 billion dollar highway construction to make shopping and getting to work easier.
the debate over 288 has consistently overlooked other things that could be spent on for $ 400 million.
if the money is applied to other pressing road projects or even to non-road projects, much traffic congestion can be alleviated.
ray hyde, my comments are directed at the investors who lobby for roads to be placed near their own property and the incompetent and unfunded system that this request is a part of.
