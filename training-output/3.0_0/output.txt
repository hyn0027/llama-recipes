support the thread starter resolutely, i am replying to compose a poem.
pledge to fight to the death to defend diaoyu islands and related islands.
bumping the fishing boats fleet, showing their wolfish appearance again, the little evil ghost of japan stirs up unrest and makes trouble
never go back to that time when we appeared humiliated when we signed the treaty, china is strong, sharp the sword, shine the knife, bury the approaching enemy.
2010-09-11
i agree with the analysis of the person who started the thread, if there really is a war, i will be hua mulan to protect our home, defend our homeland, spread the prestige of our china, and pledge to fight to the death to defend our national dignity.
i wish i could bear that passionate upsurge of mao zedong's long march to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all the wrongdoers and enemies of china and spread our dragon's prestige.
how long will we tolerate japan?
i say to my fellow citizens.
hello everyone, we all know about the september 18 th incident, but japan now has premeditated plans for another sea incident, similar to the lugou bridge incident, again.
surprisingly, japan defied the strong condemnation of the whole world and openly invaded our sacred territory, the diaoyu islands.
diaoyu islands have always belonged to china, we all know that, it is because of historical reasons that the original thing we belong to has become controversial.
fellow citizens, i ask you, what is it that we are? why is there a need for negotiation? japan has gone even further, wanting to create a fact of occupation. can we allow this? absolutely not!
i say to my fellow citizens, japan's militarism brought grave disasters to the asian people.
china suffered long-term ravages from japan for several decades.
the japanese unit 731 experimented on chinese, korean and other people with extremely brutal methods on human bodies in the northeast cruelly and cruelly; the nanjing massacre added a layer of blood that will never fade away in the ancient capital; the bloody and big battle in hengyang and changsha has barely left the bones of the dead over a thousand kilometers away and killed everything.
i have too many instances on record that would not be possible to cite to my fellow citizens for the heinous crimes committed by japan in china.
just like those millions of deceased souls who lost their lives, wandering over the pacific ocean, and finding it difficult to rest in peace.
all those who experienced that era still remember it vividly, and even our younger generation also cries down the stream of tears from our cheeks and boils with indignation at any time we turn the page of history and read it.
actually, japan now wants to reverse the verdict on its aggressive history, so it's waking up fellow citizens and chinese in asia.
we must go forward, although it is painful to look back at these 100 years of shame, we must create history and choose history, but the historical issues are not resolved.
responsible is why we have no fear, although the territory is small, it relates to matters of dignity, the interests of the country and the nation are guaranteed, regardless of how the wind and cloud changes, we can not let our native land be separated, even if it is scarred with wounds.
fellow citizens, the 21st century adventure is the time when we are beset from within and pressured from without, and china faces many challenges.
how do we go about dealing with the taiwan issue, the tibet issue, the south china sea issue, the surrounding environment and the aggressive foreign forces of china?
fellow citizens, i ask you to look at the world map and see how the crescent-shaped encirclement suppresses our breathing, strangles our development and covets our national territory.
we never fear people, we don't want to make our enemies, but we don't fear war, we don't want war.
we must urgently arrange our arms and strengthen all our military forces on land, sea and air.
china has never had the ambition of expanding its territory outward, but for several thousand years, china has flourished as a nation.
we do not impose on others what we do not want, so we follow the strategic philosophy of foreign security that applies benevolence and virtue.
like individuals, countries are tolerant and liberal, but we have to insist that we willn't hurt ourselves, so we must avoid hurting other people.
tolerance is not certain fear, and sincerity is not a necessity of cowardice.
china's exemption from japan's war repair caused by world war ii serves the benevolent peace.
i say to my fellow citizens, the people's heroes monument is a condensed history of the chinese nation that is striving to continue to improve.
the solemn and magnificent posture represents sacred expectations of peace.
my memory string is agitated from time to time by the many heroic and tragic scenes that come to mind, of shining spears and armored horses.
my thoughts go to that yellow page of history, like i see kangxi, the emperor who contemplated how he achieved unification of the territories alone in his audience hall hundreds of years ago, and also abraham lincoln, the former u.s. president who wandered alone in the dark great hall and thought of the integrity of the union.
peaceful world is certainly dangerous to forget the war, i say to my fellow citizens, we must never exercise forbearance with blind want, we want development and peace, but the modern boxer protocol, which is a betrayal and humiliation of the nation, has aggravated china's poverty and backwardness, and falling behind is the lead to bullying.
what happens when peace is not strong?
we must focus on national defense education, build up a great wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people, and establish a full-range and capable national defense system to defend the nation.
the best defense is a good offense. · strengthen our force that can engage in long-range attacks, and improve our deep and great combat capabilities in all aerospace · increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment, and establish high-quality elite high-tech divisions on the premise of avoiding the influence of national economic development.
the battle horns are about to sound, people are fully equipped and ready to go.
without the support of the people, we accomplish nothing, but with the support of the people, we are all powerful.
i say to my fellow citizens, time and again we have said no to other people, and time and again we have achieved.
1) establish a guarantee fund, improve the working environment and work mechanism, recruit millions of information technology professionals who have lingered in the united states and around the world back to china.
2. a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were created.
3. manufacture 5,000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds.
4. accelerate research and deployment of high-speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles, which could break missile defense systems.
5. nuclear experiments resumed and military forces established in space.
6. retain 1,000 nuclear bombs (equivalent to 100 million tons of trinitrotoluene) and install nuclear warheads on all short- and medium-range missiles when needed.
7. retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
8. abandon your commitment to not first use nuclear weapons.
9. retain the right to pre-emptive strike in the face of national security threats.
fellow citizens, i say, if we are only confident of ourselves and improve ourselves, we can strive to be strong. qin shi huang unified china, zheng chenggong recovered taiwan, we must carry on the far-sightedness, insight and strong will of our predecessors.
now that land that trembles far away from motherland's embrace and moans and calls is shaking, fellow citizens, let us carry forward the unfulfilled wishes of the previous generations with courageous forward movement, and let us move forward courageously with the unfulfilled wishes of the previous generations.
while reading history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmered, which is why i am concerned. i am willing to serve our motherland as a volunteer to make our motherland prosper and be splendid once again, but i am a common person and will bear to the cloth gown, and i am adequately showing my sincere and patriotic heart to heaven.
i composed this poem here in classical ci form to voice my aspirations of the heart.
paint your lips deep red.
protect the diaoyu islands.
we lost our ryukyu islands bitterly.
how can we allow the diaoyu islands to fall into other countries?
100 years of vicissitude.
smoke and cloud chased the flying wave.
the youngest brother is still a tender youth.
wandered all directions and the seal bore.
flags looked over.
we brandished our weapons and crossed east.
let the horses drink from the pacific ocean.

<a href="http://www.amren.com/mtarchives/2008/08/the_chinese_in_taiwan.php#more"> title: the chinese in taiwan - amren </a>
why don't we fight the little country of japan?
what still tolerated by chinese people?
they even ride our heads.
still, the gutless chinese are doing this?
we should tell the whole world that china can not be bullied at will.
time to show our strength, china is too calm for too long.
citizens' lives are all too careless currently, officials are extravagant too.
we don't have cohesion already, china needs to start a war, the faces of the countries following the us rear are going to be harshly slapped.
let them know the us is not a panacea; if we win, our victory may increase china's influence; and improve citizen cohesion; if we lose, we can clean out the incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out; let china have new blood and update; get china up to speed.
china, go!
i suggest that china strengthen its guard of the diaoyu islands, and guard them every day, and protect the fishermen and our country's sovereignty. if japan dares to invade our territory by military force, we will fight a small-scale war to defend ourselves, regardless of the cost. china cann't lose.
we need to show life, but really, you showing someone you are embraced by someone...
i just passed by.
this is what the whole society, including the stars, resemble.
damn, not sexy.
it cann't be totally accepted.
just a cheap entertainer, their reputation in feudal china is somewhat sensible.
their lives look glorious.
a group of nine professionals.
life is hard.
shocked
that's normal, and whores are always heartless and unrighteous performers.
they want the money, not the face.
look at the wolf near ms. fan with glasses, you know that the actor must drink with him otherwise he will not be forced out or even not even framed.
son of a bitch
as long as there's something lovely to eat, it's okay.
no one is easy, life is like a show, you have to look at the script to know how to perform.
all somebody.
top scorer in the imperial examination all his life, and behind him is so much effort and endeavor, this humiliates the word " bean vermicelli "
haha.
overdoing it
reality.
shoot that hooligan.
cheap performers.
cheap performers.
the entertainment circle is dirty, all the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
pity them, but who to blame?
everybody does this, how can you make money if you don't?
when a woman is in front of other people, she is proud, but when she is alone, she is melancholy.
in ancient times, the popular prostitutes were just the stars nowadays, they are now famous prostitutes, so it is just normal for them to drink or even sleep with some high officials.
stop talking to other people, just behave.
what should we do in the future? we are also facing such hard choices too? alone, it is not enough to be successful?
the suffering is undisputedly more, but it is disguised as glorious.
it's not so bad, they just play in their own circle, not seeing or keeping in mind things.
but there's an old guy named zhang jizhong who behaves like a hooligan in his circle and thinks he's virtuous without talent, he makes a tv series when he has nothing to do to wreck the whole country's people.
both took what they needed.
when will china have a pure and innocent girl?
now the story is very shocking in the entertainment world, rumor has it that hsu yuki was forced out because she refused to drink with guests arranged by the company, and she was obliged to switch to working as an assistant to a lawyer to make an end meeting instead.
superstars often encounter social encounters or circumstances they are not welcome to but have to join in.
they cann't decide on many things after all, because it has to do with many aspects and interests of many people.
sometimes, a very normal dinner party for us, which we imagine would be like that for a star, is not so simple after all.
the star has a lot of contracts and if he tackles well, his source of money will roll in, if not, she will come to her heels, either by being forced out or even in a frame.
there are two smart female stars:
the second kind of person is good at playing tricks and achieving his objectives with his own seed money.
rumor has it that even some super-female stars have won their first role this way.
after drinking some alcohol, the advertiser or sponsor of the show may have a chance to lie on the shoulder of the female star, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, and this is the endurance attitude that the female star has adopted most.
they are very low nine professions.
those stars are just pretending and actually living a damn good life much better than this.
just a cheap entertainer, their reputation in feudal china is somewhat sensible.
agree.
oh well, the actors aren't easy to translate.
they deserve it, they asked for it.
nothing is easy for me, dawn.
women are birds and beasts, and men are worse.
brawk!
brawk!
it doesn't take long.
route 288, a circumferential highway that runs around the southwest quadrant of the richmond-new urban region, opened in late 2004.
it has already changed the development pattern, causing localized traffic congestion around its exits, and will change the development pattern and worsen it, causing localized traffic congestion around its exits.
the richmond times dispatch tells the tale of the impact of huguenot trail in powhatan county today.
will jones reported that traffic on one section of huguenot trail has more than doubled since 288 opened.
speed and accident surges as well.
so far this year, 17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of winterfield road, up from 12 all of 2004.
dale totten, a residential engineer with the virginia department of transportation, notes that the 4-lane road would cost about $ 13 million if the state had more money.
of course, vdot does not have the money to construct roads in the richmond region.
because vdot spent all their frigging money on 288 because of local politicians and boosters.
where is homer simpson when you need him?
this is a major moment, doh!
we predict that route 288 will generate residential development in the scarce populated area around all the exits, overtaxing a local country road.
other people choose where they work and where they live, but limited access highways can relieve traffic for drivers back and forth between chesterfield and goochland counties.
and they create traffic congestion in new places.
i'm only surprised at how rapid this is.
even i think it could be 3-4 years lag.
think about it, the road was already created at a cost of $ 13 million just to create this one exit, so the road is liable to create all of its own exits.
another predictable thing.
road improvement needs soared after a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of a megaproject at the intersection of 288 and a major road.
well, we may see the liability of the unfunded zooning past the well over 4 billion dollars that the original highway took to build by the end of the decade.
the idea is that of a brainiac who thinks that route 288 is such a great idea.
thanks for nothing.
i think we could spend $ 400 million better elsewhere.
i think you shouldn't blame 288 for creating those people.
what if they're not enough to create new traffic congestion in new places?
additional traffic congestion in the old place?
now you understand what tmt in fairfax feels like.
i usually take a pro-road position.
288 is definitely excessive, but there are glaring needs in other parts of the state.
richmond has virtually no traffic.
the last hour of rush hour lasted 30 minutes.
and give them a beltway through a large rural area.
nowhere to go but the road.
just think, this money could be spent on another potomac river crossing or on desperately needed road improvements in nova.
virginia centrist, the insult is that the rest of the state helped pay for 288 during last year's budget deal, and that added insult to injury, it wiped out the debt.
it would be very nice if you all obliged us.
but there isnt much sense to it though.
same old problem.
if you get ahead of the need, you will be accused of causing sprawl.
if you build in places where there is already an acute need, you cann't pave your way out of congestion.
anonymous
that's a fair point.
5:26 good point.
but this situation hammers home the validity of the auditor's report that the ctb and vdot funds for transport projects are based on the best lobbyists, not on a comprehensive state transportation plan.
i submit this situation is unacceptable and a disgrace.
and chichester and his toadies pour more money into this flawed institution, making it worse.
what is the purpose of the transportation expenditures?
in virginia, it is for the benefit of private business plans, not for the public interest.
you're all dead wrong.
walter stoch, less, stated the intent of the money for economic development to be paid to 288.
come on folk.
tmt, i don't understand your point.
when are you going to stick to traffic last time you went into some sort of business?
it seems to me that the whole point of the road is to facilitate the public's interest in getting into and from private business.
there is overwhelming support for business, but it's sunday, grandma's trip, and a soccer game of course.
we wouldn't suffer from congestion problems if what we expend on roads didn't not match the increase in business or domestic state product.
if we recognize the primary benefit of roads to business, we should do two things:
business will pay us more of course for the transportation bill and we will incentivize them to locate where they will stress the system the least even if it means more overall travel.
why is it so hard to understand?
to solve the functional pattern of human settlement and the balance between the transport system's capacity and travel demand generated by land use.
all else is spin.
emr
in virginia, tmt says it is for the benefit of private business plans and not for the public interest.
i don't see the point of this statement as it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else.
i think they are intertwined and tightly so that they are virtually the same.
this is a local problem because this cookie dough is lumpy.
but in the aggregate, if we demonize business long enough, we will eventually find that all of us are working for the devil.
i don't see the point in claiming that the solution is to balance a dynamic, ever changing natural balance.
even you will see the positive rail to dulles because it is a job center and will promote bidirectional demand.
i agree.
in fact, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that is all that is necessary, that is, that is all that is sufficient, that is, that
i would say the same logic should be applied to roads.
they should have both ends of the destination in order for us to use our investments to the maximum.
we need more places to get closer to the balance you say we need.
reality check here.
i drive past watkins landing every morning and evening.
i commute back and forth to my work location on huguenot trail.
i never saw anything remotely like a traffic flood.
it's a 55 mph zone where cars are going 75-100 mornings.
the road, huguenot trail, is already planned to be widened because of heavy demand from development in chesterfield, a new school, and a whole bunch of existing developments that have been zoned for years and have been funneled through robious road.
288 is wonderful for those of us who actually use it instead of the bottleneck that lack of 288 is for powhatan and western chesterfield.
we can develop commercially and work closer to our lives.
you might think that's using land irrationally.
i don't desire to live in any city.
i refuse to work in the downtown area.
i refuse to use mass transit that is unsafe for female commuters who work irregular hours and long.
and i like the idea of a large lot development.
i don't understand exactly how i'm supposed to keep a horse on a quarter acre lot.
1 gallon of gas could go for $ 10.
and i still pay for my life in the country.
many people legitimately prefer horses, hunting, gardens, and certain types of small businesses, which makes them not want to live in the urban core.
this baffles me truly with this infatuation with city living.
every person has the right to live in a country if they wish to, anonymous 6:37.
but you don't have the right to have the rest of the state underwrite a 4 billion dollar highway construction to make shopping and getting to work easier.
in the debate over 288, it was consistently overlooked that there are other things that could be spent $ 400 million on.
much of the traffic congestion could be alleviated if money was applied to other pressing road projects or even non-road projects (god forbid).
my comments are directed to ray hyde, investors who lobby for roads to be placed near their own property and the incompetent and unfunded system that ray hyde is a part of.
i'm 24 and my mother is 2.5 years old.
i have been broken up with my son's father since august.
i want to start dating other people and my son's father said that if i do that, it has nothing to do with him.
he is very possessive and controlling, but he has no right to be because we are together.
right now his life is going on too much and he thinks we can work, i've told him several times i don't love him and he doesn't love me.
i want him there for his son, not too, he doesn't need me either.
but he has no one, his family don't get along with him and they have issues.
i don't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he's around the more miserable i am.
i don't want him to be there without his son, he's either a good father or at least trying to be.
i believe every child needs both parents, whether they are together or not.
but he thinks that if he cann't have me, no one can.
what am i to do, move my life?
it's very bad when your ex-significant other threatens you using your son.
you cann't give in to that, it just escalates if you do.
you have the right to live your life and be happy, so you have no reason to cave in to his threats.
he would see the person regardless if he really loved his son, but this is just the typical method of control that people like him use.
other people are saying things like " if you leave me, i'll kill myself " - will it get through to you?
date yourself.
meet all kinds of people.
do what you want.
if you were better off without him, you probably would have been more so if he had volunteered to walk out of both your lives at a price.
i agree, one other thing is that he is not in business as of your date.
i didn't tell him.
he didn't threaten you, he didn't care about your personal life.
can you document his threats?
you really need this.
quit taking his calls and make him leave voice mail.
make him email or text you.
keep that record.
get a lawyer and divorce.
if you cann't afford one, try legal aid.
tell your ex-significant other that all communications need to go through a lawyer.
the bus driver, the people till, and the people delivering your food want the exact same change.
do they not realize that you don't get a pile of change from the bank?
someone has to take notes somewhere?
people get lazy.
i'd like to be as near as possible, because i don't like counting copper all day.
if you take a twenty pound note on the bus, they'll just tell you to get on the bus because they're as lazy as hell.
it is not legal to pay a certain amount in a load of coins, for example you can only pay 30 pence using a one pence coin.
hello, i started university in september but obviously i didn't gel with it immediately like most people.
i know it will take some time to adjust to me though, since i'm very introverted, shy, anxious, and all the rest of it.
on the first night i was here all my housemates and i went out and it was the hardest thing i've ever had to do.
when i'm sober i go to the student union bar by myself.
point is, here's the fact: 2 nd.
i didn't enjoy university after about 5 months here, i was disillusioned by the course, didn't enjoy the set project and didn't like the delivery of the course much.
the university is making out much better than it seems.
i started off badly, student finance delayed adding to my stress levels and i was so worried i couldn't progress with my work, so in conclusion all the piles have been added.
i was assigned a counselor through the university, saw him in a block session for about 5-6 weeks, and honestly, it didn't really work out because i never opened up to him.
only half a heart.
i'm loaded to the neck with work, i have to hit major deadlines, i'm depressed and the anxiety is making me feel miserable all the time.
i no longer have a counselor because you can only have them at a time so many times and i doubt they would help me at this time if they haven't already.
i lack motivation, i don't feel comfortable with the people lecturing me, i feel like i want to give in but i cann't because i end up in a dead end job and i aspire to be someone.
i'd rather die than be uneducated and not live the life i want to live, and by dropping out of university i've made matters worse.
i'm 21 years old and turning 22 this year, i don't have much time to fail and i have to do something.
i failed college once and did another course to get into university.
could someone please advise me some?
perhaps you can go and see your doctor and see if there is any way you can extend your deadline to try and ease the pressure a bit?
send an email like this post to your tutor, they will consider mitigating circumstances, don't worry, they have seen all before, i know, i used to work in the university administration department.
break your work into manageable chunks.
concentrate on one bit of work at a time (obviously start with the most urgent assignment).
don't shut off your housemate and do well, try new things from the very beginning, keep it now.
i would recommend you go see your doctor too.
speaking to someone can benefit you if you are always an anxious person, my friend got therapy from the nhs because of her anxiety, its really normal.
try to get an extension, if you're honest, i'm sure your university will allow it.
it's hard to keep strong and keep on living.
my mum divorced, and she had horrible times with my stepfather and she was sent round the bend by her new found freedom.
she has epilepsy and manic depressive with huge anger problems.
she's constantly horrible to me.
i cann't cope with her bursting out and her hateful and nasty remarks at home.
i am 18 years old and at the point of my break, i have a 95 % bursary and am studying full time at a private school with high pressure in the sixth form.
i cann't work at home because she shouts at me.
then i got angry at my teacher because...
one minute she's lovely, like i've got my mummy back, then the next minute she's turned into the most spiteful living human being.
i didn't pass my a2 exam and i've already accepted my defeat and this year of my life is going to make me fail.
i don't know if i can come back, but the university has offered me the most amazing offer, but i cann't even accept it, i never made a grade.
i wish i could wipe her out from my life, it would be so much better without her.
but then i think i'm just selfish.
but surely this is not what i mean to live like this, right?
it's good, but not so much.
but i feel like i have no control over this downhill spiral.
and i don't know what to do.
thanks for reading.
nice vent.
you cann't get her sectioned for that.
even has she a history of mental illness or a diagnosis?
you sure don't know that you won't get a good grade, so you accept a place if possible.
life throws things at you all the time.
outsiders are people who are not part of your family.
i had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for 8 years before i came to university, and honestly, that's the only reason i'm here.
if you really want out, work hard.
really, if she cann't give you consistent support, you need support from somewhere else.
can you call childline or something like that?
you can go to the library on saturday and study there for 8 good hours.
can you go to your friend's house to form a study group?
the section is a bit painful in the ass and you blame it for all your problems, so do you want her section?
i know how you feel.
my mum spits from hell too.
i would highly recommend taking up smoking.
oh tsr grew up and stopped nagging, it's a joke.
i think i'm going to become much weaker person in the next 1-2 years and i'm going to way down my personality to try to befriend some people at university.
but the overly nice people lead people to believe that they can say or do whatever they want to me, hell, i can say or do whatever i want to them.
they showed absolutely no respect.
for example, i say hello to someone from the university and they ignore me, but after 30 minutes they decide they want my help with some work and i give it.
it's caused a lot of anger and distress in my life and it's really starting to affect my concentration at university.
anyone get any experience with handling these sorts of things or how to go about getting some respect back again?
just say no.
if it is particularly uncomfortable for you, do it gradually.
you can start with " sorry i'm not but i'm busy "
of course you wouldn't go over the top with it, you wouldn't go completely the other way.
if you think about it, no, then you will say no.
when they start to realize that you are not going to bend backwards over for them, they start to respect you more.
this is really such a bad attitude well this is really such a bad attitude you can be respected of course if you are not nice but nice to the point that you just let them do anything to you then that is not nice that is foolish.
i don't know if anyone is reading this, but i just feel despair and i feel like i need to tell someone.
i left home in september and started university, i am incredibly anxious about doing this but i delayed thinking about it until i got here, i am here now and have been for over two weeks, i feel overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward.
since moving to secondary school i have struggled emotionally, i lost my dad around the age of 9 and used to always blame it on how i felt, i have had two periods of counselling in my life, one from 091200 to this year around march.
i feel momentarily overwhelmed by the problems in my life that are uncredible and make me doubt my always low self-esteem more and more, i cann't concentrate on work, i often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions and i doubt myself about anything and everything.
my two counselors did not diagnose me with depression and suggested i was not suffering from depression, but i am a huge worrier because my dad died of depression and suicide and i am worried about depression.
i've tried to solve my problems before and found that exercising and meditating were particularly useful, i've also tried things like self-help books and tapes, but generally speaking i feel that this is my life, i feel that i'm a young man, i've wasted one chance at existence and one chance at being a young man.
i simply don't know what to do, and never follow through when i think i know what to do, my friends often say i'm lazy, and i cann't disagree a lot of the time, i feel like they're trying everything they can to help me, and i fail time and time again.
sorry to anyone who read this jumbled mess, but i feel like i'm a self-seeking moaner and i truly feel desperate.
when people are in new situations and feel pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into new roles (such as university students), their feelings for other people become more intense.
i am not a health professional and can only speak from my own personal experience, so i would strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional for your depression and worries.
most people feel awkward and unintelligent when they first get to university, so you are not alone there. i would really recommend you get an appointment with the counselling service at your university, but i feel that most people do not feel like they are depressed, so really, it does not matter what anyone tells you. you have obviously some problems at the moment, and you can use some support, but meditation and exercise are really helpful, so try to do that. but you have to engage with help and general life to get somewhere, but do not beat yourself up because you feel like you are not motivated to do anything at the moment. a lot of people feel like this, and hopefully this will pass when you begin to feel better. you have to kind to yourself and get some help.
good luck
i think a lot more people would feel the same way as you, but they medicate themselves using friends, not as such a solution, but it is definitely a good thing to be around friends when you are depressed rather than alone and depressed, either way if you fancy a chat, feel free to message me privately.
if you are me, i focus on idols. you aspire to be someone who came from a bad background and ended up succeeding, happy, having a family, married, etc. you don't want to be them, but someone you admire and respect.
you focus on what you have achieved in life, you don't state what you have studied or why you have studied it, you want the experience, your mum wants you to go, do you need a degree for the career you want?
you sum up why you're there and work your butt off to get the best grade you can, either way, when you get your degree you'll have something to say like " hey, i didn't fail, i worked hard and passed "
x
i hope this helps.
i'm pretty much not autistic (i don't think doctors misdiagnosed me, i walk on my toes nearly all the time)
it's more comfortable for me.
who makes them decide that walking on toes is a sign of autism, when walking on toes seems so random and is never always an indicator?
well, i can have a thing that signals something on the autism spectrum, but what about one or two?
you guys know what i mean.
walking on toes could be a symptom of autism.
headaches can be a symptom of a brain tumor.
feeling tired a lot could be a symptom of leukaemia.
symptoms are not always applicable, but if they are a lot of the time in this instance clearly so, then without a note nothing will ever be diagnosed.
i used to walk on my toes, but now i walk with strange toes that have to be surgically straightened, which happened two years ago.
my brother is autistic, but i didn't notice it either, the spectrum is so broad, and i probably have mild asperger's, which is why i have communication problems and don't pick up on social/body language reactions.
but then i don't have the proper diagnosis and you might even have some symptoms but that doesn't mean you have a certain condition.
i've been told for years that i don't walk on my toes, so i don't walk on my toes much.
i have dyspraxia.
so you could be dyspraxic or have short tendons.
i've drilled it to the point where i find it more comfortable now.
i haven't read too much about random symptoms like that.
hello, i am a 12 year old girl (2 days after now, i will be 13) and i am an addict of self harm.
i started slitting my fingers with scissors at the age of 7 and never stopped from that day on.
it's gotten worse because i have a scar on my leg from when i slit it open stapling for my ex boyfriend's name because i didn't stop cutting when i was bleeding.
i have several slits in my arm.
they healed and then i cut myself with staples and razors.
when i cann't find a cutting tool i take around 5 paracetamol and other drugs and take them with lager and vodka.
when i write this, i'm really tempted to cut my arms off or burn myself.
i am an addict, when one heals i will cut again.
i think about it every day.
i'm 12 and my life is already sickening me.
this is from a story i wrote about my dad leaving when i was 7 and not wanting to know me anymore.
he just cares about his little new girl, his wife and his new life that i don't want.
my best mate died when i was 10 years old.
i am in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and have been forbidden to speak to him due to the events and the age difference.
my mum also suffers from bipolar and i have depression.
i don't want to stop.
i don't care what i do, i want to do it over and over again to torture myself, i hate myself.
but i love my best mate loads and he means the world to me and if he does anything i will do anything.
i wouldn't tell him, but he'll find out.
i don't want to hurt him, he doesn't want to hurt himself.
what do i do?
thank you for reading.
are you on any drugs or does any drug get any therapy?
talk to your school nurse or your gp and tell them what's going on.
your trusted teacher, who you can tell, is a school teacher.
if you tell people, they can help you.
if you keep it bottled up inside, it's only going to get worse.
trust me, it's better to get this thing as early as possible instead of letting it even worsen.
don't do this.
i'm 17 and started self harming (mainly cutting my arms) last year, but stopped a few months ago.
it's hard but you can do it.
i feel so much happier but seeing the scar reminds me of how i felt at that time and how strong those feelings were and that's why i want to do such things to myself.
also strong, you can do it, i found it saved by writing poetry and keeping a journal.
self harm is addictive but you can overcome it.
remember, self harm is not a defining characteristic of who you are.
you can overcome it.
i've been thinking i've gotten ocd because i've always been checking to make sure i haven't lost or left anything behind whenever i go out, especially to university, so i find myself checking my belongings all the time.
i often have to check every 2 nd go and then after 30 seconds i cann't resist checking again for some reason.
why is this?
or i'm crazy or something?
it's often when it carries many things, but rarely, and even checks many times a day, is this ocd to any extent?
what can i do about this?
i get very anxious if i don't check, but often the anxiety is so much that i cann't wait that long.
i feel doomed if i lose my wallet or phone.
i just wish i could go out without having to worry every two minutes if i left something or lost something.
i really don't know what to do and i'm afraid to go to a general practitioner.
they probably never heard of some compulsion like this and i just don't know what to do.
do any of you have similar rituals?
people think i'm crazy but it's very strange how difficult it is to get out of this.
what advice can you give me?
i used to do this on the way to college back in the day, had a list of items i knew i had and used to compulsively check on the bus.
i have more anxiety now and think this is a warning sign, so just try to wean yourself from the habit while it's relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor, but also tell them not to keep checking for this thing.
don't worry about that, the doctor saw a much worse case.
in my psychology class today we did an ocd thing, lol.
you may just be avoiding compulsive actions by avoiding the manner in which you rid yourself of it, so don't check to see if you've lost something and just leave it.
your ocd levels will gradually decrease over time, although your anxiety levels will increase over time, hopefully your ocd will disappear over time.
that just sounds like you're over anxious instead of having a really bad ocd.
i am obsessed to the point that i get up every 20 minutes to check that all the locks in my house are particularly locked.
sometimes i am convinced they are not locked, even though i know they are.
i think it becomes a real problem when obsessive interruptions really start to interrupt your daily routine.
you're definitely not crazy, so don't worry, and i'm sure your gp will understand the issue.
i also go for therapy for other reasons and they encourage me to pick a number less than 20 to check and stick with it and cut down.
i think the idea is to teach me, and i'm still ok if i check in 5 times or 20 times.
i'm so far good, a lot more than i thought i would be, and i definitely think anyone who wants to improve can.
i'm usually pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and not worry too much about them.
but i find myself becoming really anxious about things over the past month or so and i'm not talking about mere nervousness from the blue.
i began to feel irrationally panicky about a variety of things that i hadn't worried about too much before, things that i didn't even come to mind as something that would cause alarm bells to ring in my head.
i'm not sure this is the cause of this lifestyle change (going from a free care student to an unemployed graduate) or a sign of other issues, but this is beginning to bug me because it affects my confidence and happiness.
i spoke to a few people, including my parents, about it, but all think i'm going through a random phase and should hold off on acting until the serious problems are clear.
so what's the best thing to do?
and you speak to the doctor and see if there is any edge taking off anxiety pills might have?
i see that i can speak to a counselor?
or should i take the advice of the people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem?
well, you should not start trying to keep an eye on your anxiety, because that will make you tense and more likely to panic, and there's a demise circle there.
i would recommend that you try to focus on something that will guarantee you a smile or make you feel happier when you start to feel a bit panicky.
or if you cann't do that, get your friends to make you laugh when you start to feel panicky, or it will work for me and i will suffer random panic attacks lol
i'm just starting to get really worried about the tiny things, although it doesn't sound as severe as you are.
i find talking about what makes you anxious just helps me, not someone else.
i found it a bit of a non-moan way to find that i'd mentioned my worries to my mum and she'd seen how i'd reacted to the situation with a calmness that i'd recommend, which made me feel better about it, so i know that it's not a big deal and i don't need to be anxious about it.
but if it worsens, go to the doctor.
i have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety which prevents him from leaving the house and doing things, because he worries so much about what might go wrong.
the doctor gave her medication and it made her much better.

some 2500 university students formed a human chain in osaka sunday to protest the ongoing military campaign led by the united states in iraq.
20-year-old rally organizer miyako fuji told jiji news, " we cann't forgive this war. "
i want to join together with each of us as individuals who oppose the war to feel as one.
news agency jiji said protesters carrying placards reading " stop the war, love and peace " exceeded the number of people expected to show up at osaka castle park in downtown osaka, where the protesters formed a human chain after 3 p.m. (6 a.m. gmt).
the protests were followed by a string of other protests involving tens of thousands of peace activists across japan since january.
78 of 100 people surveyed by kyodo news agency's poll released saturday said they opposed military action in iraq.
a separate poll of 1,846 adults conducted by the yomiuri newspaper, which publishes tuesday, shows that 64 percent of the adults feel that japan has no choice but to back the united states, while only 12 percent say that japan has every reason to back the war.
britain's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown named the current head of the country's energy regulator on tuesday as the new chairman of the financial services authority's (fsa) financial watchdog.
former senior banker callum mccarthy began his job as one of the most important jobs in the london financial world in september, when incumbent howard davies stepped down.
davies left to become chairman of the london school of economics, one of the best known parts of the university of london.
brown said mccarthy would bring " non-rival " combinations of public sector experience, senior industry practice and highly successful regulator chairman to the federal security agency.
mccarthy currently heads the office of gas and electricity markets, which regulates britain's privatized energy industry.
mccarthy, who previously held senior positions at barclays bank, barclays investment bank and kleinwort benson, is a former civil servant with the department of trade and industry.
in november 2001 the financial services authority (fsa) became the sole british regulator of financial services, taking on various functions from nine separate agencies, watched by davies.
at least three members of a tribal family were hacked to death in the northeastern indian state of tripura on thursday for allegedly practicing witchcraft, police said.
a spokesman said that on wednesday a group of 25 to 30 armed men attacked the house of a quack doctor from the village 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of the tripuras capital agartala in the tultuli region.
before fleeing the area, the mob dragged out and killed three members of the family with machetes and spears, said a spokesman by telephone from agartala.
the quack doctor nityalila naotia, 55, and her teenage son, and another unidentified family member died.
the spokesman said naotia was a practicing sorcerer and cast evil spells on the villagers with his black magic, prompting the village group to eliminate them.
police arrested 4 people in connection with the killing.
in parts of tripura and other northeastern states of india, superstitious beliefs, black magic and demonology are integrated into tribal customs.
many tribes practice a faith that mixes black magic and superstition with belief.
30 people died during a week of seasonal rain in oman.
muscat, april 19 (reuters)
police said 30 people, including five indians, four pakistanis and a family of united arab emirates swept away in their car during a week of heavy seasonal rains in oman, died on saturday.
seven people were killed when the wadi, or dry river, overflowed after rain in the wilayat region near the uae border, police spokesman abdullah al-harthy said.
five indians and four pakistanis died, according to officials from the indian and pakistani embassies.
the decomposed body of rajasthan state worker dharam datt choyal was found on friday, said bhupinder singh, first secretary at the indian embassy.
two other indian workers were still missing after choyal's truck was swept away by a flash flood in muscat on monday.
police reported 16 people have died since the rain began 2 days ago.
the sun is back out on saturday and traffic is running normally in the capital.
meteorological officials said it seemed the wet spell that started with a bang monday was ending.
muscat's largest market, muttrah souq, reopened on saturday after being knee-deep in flood water for three days.
a pakistani court in the central province of punjab sentenced a christian man to life imprisonment for blasphemy, according to police on sunday.
district court judge shahid rafiq in faisalabad found ranjha masih guilty of defiling verses from the koran at a 1998 rally by the minority christian community.
they said that the judge also ordered ranjha to pay a 50,000 rupee (about 870 us dollars) fine in the verdict handed down on saturday.
ranjha is accused of tearing down a billboard carrying verses from the koran in the city of faisalabad during a christian demonstration after the city bishop committed suicide in 1985 under a blasphemy law.
john joseph bishop of faisalabad, a catholic who campaigned against the law, was shot in the head outside the sahiwal district court in 1998 while a christian ayub masih was convicted under the law in 1998 by a judge.
ayub masih was charged in 1996 with blasphemy for allegedly defending british author salman rushdie, whose novel the satanic verses infuriated radical muslim clerics who accused rushdie of defaming islam.
last year, pakistan's supreme court acquitted ayub masih, who denied uttering words against islam or the prophet mohammad.
blasphemy is punishable by death under pakistan's pakistan penal code (pakistan law).
however, blasphemy convicts are never executed in the country.
christian rights activists say the main use of the anti-blasphemy law introduced by late military dictator general zia-ul-haq is to persecute christians or settle land feuds.
the beleaguered french media group vivendi universal said friday it had advanced negotiations to sell its theme park business to a us firm for around $ 1.5 billion.
the report comes as creditors say the group plans to sell off its us vivendi universal entertainment unit and other assets to focus on telecom and its french cable tv business.
the times says vivendi universal is negotiating to sell its flagship theme park to new york-based investment firm blackstone group as the first step in dismantling its entertainment empire.
vivendi universal officials in the united states were immediately unavailable for comment on friday.
blackstone group has reportedly bought vivendi's theme park division, which includes universal studios hollywood and universal orlando in florida, and the company's interest in owning parks in spain and japan, according to a paper source close to the buy negotiations.
blackstone already holds a 50 percent stake in two of universal orlando's parks.
vivendi confirmed this week that it had been speculated in the press for months that the company was planning to shed its entertainment assets, including the famous movie studio universal and its television assets, before the end of the year.
at the annual general meeting on tuesday, chief executive jean-rene fourtou told shareholders that the sale of vivendi universal entertainment is a major goal for 2003 and that negotiations are already underway.
fourtou says he has not yet received a firm offer from the us giant's music division, and has not taken a final decision on the future of the business.
once a utility and french company, the group must reshape itself to slash its huge debt of around 18 billion dollars.
the group recorded a net loss of 23.3 billion euros in 2002, the biggest ever in france.
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom stressed wednesday that qatar's role in the middle east peace process is a " crucial " one during talks with qatari counterpart sheikh hamad bin jassem bin jabr al-thani in paris.
shalom told a joint press conference with mahmud abbas, the newly appointed palestinian prime minister, that relations between the tiny gulf state and palestine could boost peace.
we are discussing the process of middle east peace.
shalom said after an hour of talks that we assert that both israel and the arab world will do everything to return to the negotiating table.
qatar is a very important country in this issue.
he said he knew abu mazen had a special relationship with the qatari foreign minister.
shalom's first meeting with an arab counterpart since taking office as israel's foreign minister on february 27 was an encounter.
qatar has economic links with israel despite not maintaining diplomatic relations with israel and faces criticism from other arab countries for the links.
shalom later flew to london to talk to british prime minister tony blair and foreign secretary jack straw.
on tuesday, the white house said president george w. bush told canadian prime minister jean chretien in a telephone call that he looked forward to seeing him at upcoming summits with major industrialized nations and russia.
bush spokesman ari fleischer said the two leaders will discuss the upcoming g-8 meeting, us-canada relations and other international issues over the next several days before the june 1-3 summit in france.
both said they looked forward to seeing each other in evian.
fleischer said they also touched on afghanistan, the situation in the democratic republic of the congo and the global economy.
amid chill in relations with iraq's opponents, bush has not definitely postponed a visit to canada, instead choosing to host australian prime minister john howard, who endorses the military campaign in iraq.
chretien told reporters monday that he and bush will discuss a wide range of issues, including iraq, the upcoming group of eight summit of the world's most powerful industrial nations, and aid to africa, where bush hasn't spoken to him since late february.
we're always on good terms.
the canadian leader said we just disagree on one item.
the chief minister of india's main opposition party told an election rally on saturday that the prime minister and president were bachelors because india suffered from the curse of nature, according to a report.
atal behari vajpayee, the country's prime minister and president abdul kalam have offended the hindu rain god varuna by remaining bachelors, the times of india newspaper reported, quoting digvijay singh, the state minister of central indian state madhya pradesh.
the country is ruled by a bachelor president and a prime minister who is unmarried.
singh said the hindu shastra books say this is not a very auspicious time and it will cause widespread heatwaves and droughts.
he added that the bachelor status of president kalam, rather than prime minister vajpayee, has made india an arid and barren country devoid of fertility.
pramod mahajan, general secretary of vajpayee's ruling bharatiya janata party, retorted that singh's statement was contemptuous.
india reels from heatwave since mid-may that has killed 1403 people.
rajasthan, the western desert state, is also brace for a straight five years of drought.
the skeleton of the second baby was found in a rural wisconsin home where a 22-year-old woman's dead infant was discovered in a plastic blue container on june 8, officials said monday.
kristin scott's mother told police that scott had given birth to two babies, one unknown sex in april 2001 and the other a full-term girl on january 14, at her parents' home in byrds creek, richland county.
police arrested her saturday in abilene, texas, where she moved june 2 with a friend.
she was held on $ 50,000 bail on charges of reckless homicide and hiding a corpse when an infant was born in january.
scott told police she didn't tend to the baby and it died 30 minutes later.
she said the baby must die, according to the criminal complaint.
after going to look for the source of the foul odor in their house, william and nancy scott found the decomposed body of their first baby in a closet.
according to the complaint, scott told investigators that he had moved that body from time to time from the closets of his house in byrds creek, sometimes from his car trunk, and from a closet in his apartment in richland center.
the sheriff has not released other details about the second baby.

palestinian police took over all posts and positions held before 28 september 2000.
since the start of the intifada, they have been the first to move in cars and weapons, said the source.
the move marks a step forward in carrying out the huge middle east roadmap, backed by the united states of america, which aims to end the months of bloodshed and create a lasting peace between israel and the palestinians.
police took up positions there and in the neighboring town of beit lahiya, following the israeli troop withdrawal from the northern town of beit hanoun late sunday, he said.
they also deployed along the israeli border.
the palestinian authority must be tested on credibility by handing over the men in the wake of the hardline groups plotting attacks on the jewish state.
almost three years after the first intifada (army) allowed palestinians to circulate freely on the trans-gaza highway, another first occurred when israeli troops abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastal territory.
after the army withdrawal, traffic flowed freely at the netzarim junction south of gaza city, at the kissufim junction near the central gaza strip city of deir al-balah, and at the guest house junction just south of gaza city.
three military checkpoints along the entire length of the gaza strip transformed a 30-minute ordinary ride from south to north into a two-hour or three-hour grinding ordeal, coming to symbolize the horror of occupation.
israel has implemented most of the agreement, except for a few issues, according to a source who pointed out that israel still has two military observation posts at the kissufim and guest house junctions.
he said several other roads remained temporarily closed but movement was free along the trans-gaza highway.
the eastern-west road named karni-netzarim and the section of the highway that passes close to the settlement of kfar darom, just south of the guest house junction, are still closed, he added, saying they are likely to open in the coming weeks.
another road leading to the southern border town of rafah from the city of khan yunis will open within the next 10 days, he said.
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were installed at the netzarim and guest house junction crossings in response to palestinian complaints, but said the troops were only there when jewish settlers needed to use the roads.
the ban on allowing palestinian men under 35 to move freely will be lifted, but still under force, with an expected lifting after monday or early tuesday.
the palestinian source said the army also handed over control of the rafah border crossing, which straddles the gaza strip and egypt, to palestinian people.
six palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the palestinian section of the border crossing, which israel troops took over shortly after the start of the rise-up.
the oslo accord of 1993 granted the palestinians autonomy measures, but the border crossing at rafah between egypt and israel is jointly managed by israel and the palestinians, with israel having final control of the zone.
israel has occupied the palestinian section for more than two years, but the crossings between the two territories are open in principle, although they are frequently closed for reasons rarely explained.
witnesses said 5 iraqi civilians, including a woman, were killed monday when their house was hit by a missile fired from a us-led coalition warplane.
they said their house was located in al-azamiyah, one of baghdad's most populous areas.
one house was destroyed in the strike and casualties were removed from the area.
the us-led coalition launched a new round of air strikes in baghdad at 2:30 p.m. (1130 gmt) monday.
they said there were huge explosions in different parts of the capital baghdad and air raid sirens sounded in the city and added that iraqi artillery began to fire back at the aircraft.
at least 130 iraqi civilians were reportedly killed in the first five days of the war, but coalition leaders have repeatedly assured that they are making every effort to minimize civilian casualties in the current iraq war.
other reports reaching here say 5 syrian bus passengers were killed and 10 others injured sunday morning when the bus, traveling near the syrian-iraqi border, was hit by a us missile.
the vehicles carried syrian refugees fleeing the war in iraq.
16 people were killed by tornadoes in eastern china.
hefei, july 9
a tornado swept through wuwei county in eastern anhui province on tuesday night, killing 16 people and injuring 162.
the state disaster relief office said several towns were struck by tornadoes at 10:10 p.m. tuesday and 2 a.m. wednesday.
57 people were still being treated for serious injuries in hospitals.
the official said the storm affected 23681 people, destroyed 715 houses and caused an estimated direct economic loss of 240 million yuan (39 million us dollars).

a lack of precautions was blamed for an avalanche accident in northwest china.
menyuan county, china, april 5 th, 2006
the search for the two missing outdoor tourists in northwest china ’s qinghai province continued tuesday and lack of precautions left one dead, the main reason for the tragedy, officials said.
deng haiping, head of the state-administered mountaineering organization in charge of rescue operations, said the six tourists had no experience climbing snow-covered mountains and little knowledge of the terrain.
there are six members of the outdoor sports club in xining, the capital of qinghai province.
of the three survivors, lu shimin said the first two climbers were the two who climbed such mountains.
deng said they have no compass, altitude measuring apparatus, let alone the special communication equipment usually used in mountains.
he also said that the bold idea of the snow slide was the cause of the deadly avalanche.
six people were injured in an accident on saturday afternoon when they slid down from a height of 3,700 meters on daban mountain in ertanggou, menyuan hui autonomous county, haibei tibetan autonomous prefecture.
3 survivors reported to police who started rescue operations with the help of villagers.
one body was found early sunday morning.
hong kong headquarters of the rescue organization said one of those listed as missing was in hong kong but his identity was undefined.
deng said he could take the id card with him and his mandarin name is hung zhihua and the local government will try to find out his identity with the hong kong special administrative region.
a fifth rescue team has been dispatched to search for the missing person and more than 140 rescuers are now involved in the operation.
deng said that thick snow and new avalanche signs have hampered rescue work.
deng said we found no clues but two helmets in the last three days.
officials in los angeles are mulling ways to accommodate people evacuated from katrina.
los angeles, september 6 th
los angeles county and city officials will try to determine on tuesday how best to accommodate at least 2,000 evacuees expected to be brought to the gulf coast after the katrina aftermath.
officials said los angeles county supervisor gloria molina and los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa will assemble key members of their administrations over the labor day weekend to assess whether the county and city can host thousands of displaced families who survived the disastrous hurricane.
molina and villaraigosa committed to taking at least 2,000 evacuees.
local officials announced earlier this week that a task force of city and county of los angeles personnel will be created to assist katrina evacuees with transitioning and transitioning for the long term.
the california state emergency office, federal government, city and county departments and non-profit organizations such as the red cross coordinated local efforts.
the county supervisor and mayor activated the los angeles county emergency operations center to prepare for an intensive response involving assistance to evacuees.
dozens of people have already traveled from los angeles county to louisiana and alabama ruins and are sheltered at the dream center, a non-profit agency.
new task forces will be prepared to assist with shelter, support services, information and coordination of private sector assistance to find permanent housing for evacuees as soon as possible.
molina and villaraigosa called on the private sector and non-profit organizations to help provide the needs of children and families coming from the los angeles area.
at least 33 people died in rajasthan floods.
new delhi, aug 22
the death toll from the floods in rajasthan touched 33 as five more people were swept away in the past 48 hours in the desert state where nine districts face the fury of monsoon rains.
the situation continues to be bad in udaipur, dungarpur, barmer, pali, sirohi, jalore, kota and jhalawar districts.
over 1,500 villages and towns in this district continue to be submerged.
in some places, the continued rain also hampered relief operations, causing some to operate at a snail's pace.
flooding has disrupted electricity and telephone networks in affected areas and widespread flooding has affected road and rail networks.
udaipur, the lake city, is definitely closing schools and colleges.
chief minister vasundhara raje said the situation in the flood-affected areas was still grim.
the situation is slowly improving and less water is flowing to the dam where the water is constantly discharged, the chief minister said.
raje said an assessment of losses caused by the floods would be done soon and a memorandum would be sent to the indian government seeking assistance for rehabilitation and relief operations.
the indian army continues operations in flood-affected areas of the state and has dropped food packets by helicopter in the affected areas.
7 dead and 98 injured in china tornadoes
hefei, july 4 (reuters)
the disaster relief authority said that seven people were confirmed dead and 98 others injured in the tornado that hit the eastern chinese city on tuesday.
the state disaster relief office said in a press release wednesday that seven bodies, including three in renhe township and four in qinlan township, were found in the debris of collapsed buildings.
all the injured villagers were treated at the local hospital.
one of the 10 seriously injured people is in critical condition, the doctor said.
officials calculated that the tornado, packing winds of 100 kilometers (60 miles) per hour, still caused damage in the eastern chinese city of tianchang in the anhui province, destroying more than 100 homes and forcing the evacuation of at least 1,100 people from three villages.
vice governor of the province zhao shucong led a relief team to tianchang wednesday morning, promising relief funds, materials and medical assistance.
many chinese provinces have reported disastrous weather in recent weeks, as floods hit the country's center and south while drought persists in the north.
the state flood and draught prevention headquarters said that floods had caused 233 people to die and destroyed 118500 houses in 18 areas on monday, but draughts had left nearly 74 million people short of drinking water.
residents were evacuated after massive landslides occurred in central china.
yichang, hubei province, april 20
local authorities said about 200 people were evacuated on sunday night as they were threatened by a massive ongoing landslide in central china's hubei province.
head of the land resource bureau of xingshan county, du honghui, said that 200 people, including teachers and residents, were evacuated to a middle school in gaoyang city.
continued rain triggers slides of 60,000 cubic meters of land.
the 2,000 cubic meters of mud rock caused a flow of mud rock that inundated a nearby primary school and a village with 37 homes.
at 10 p.m. on sunday, the ground floor of the classroom of the teaching building of gaoyang primary school center was covered with 1 meter deep mud, and all the windows, pupil desks and chairs were damaged.
the playground was inundated with mud 3 to 5 centimeters thick.
du said the rescue effort was underway and the situation of the landslides was closely monitored.
no casualty reports because primary schools don't have classes on weekends.
since monday, the authorities have decided to suspend primary school classes for three days.
up to 106 mm of rain has fallen so far.
weather forecasters say the rain will continue into the coming days, continuing to swell the underground water exuding from the landslide site.
disaster relief staff expect the area of landslides to worsen due to bad weather.
two people were killed by up to 141 mm rainstorms over the past three days in hubei province.
motorcyclists swept away as they passed a bridge.
the other person was killed by the lightning strike.
the state government said that the storm that caused flash flooding in some areas affected nearly 830,000 people in 16 counties and cities in hubei province.

survivors from the southern myanmar town of laputta, who escaped death from nargis with much hardship, said they had experienced a terrible human tragedy.
survivors from the farming village of pinzalu, in laputta, which lies deep in the countryside, said pinzalu had stood the hardest hit, with total collapse of houses and waves of 20 feet high, caused by cyclone storms, driving through.
he said that when he tried to swim to escape, he was carrying his two young daughters and one of them died shortly from the violent storm.
he had no alternative, but he abandoned his dying daughter to the waves and tried to keep afloat for a long time by holding onto a fallen branch nearby.
he cried out because another of his daughters was found dead in his hand after the storm winds stopped for a moment.
he recalls the tide wave sweeping his parents away at the start of the tragedy and being left alone to live his life.
he said the storm waves had swept away many others in his village in a similar way, and he had walked to laputta afterwards, witnessing all the houses in the village under water on the way.
he didn't find drinking water and food when he faced hunger so he tried to survive the hunger by drinking the coconut juice that had fallen.
another woman villager told local media that she escaped by staying on the roof of the hut, but was struck by a falling bamboo caused by the wind.
the storm swept away the people who stood in the way of the strike overnight.
she said she walked through laputta and saw many people die on the way and estimated that the storm killed three quarters of the people in her village.
she described only five people remaining alive in the nearby village of yway ywa.
a teacher from the village of yay wai ywa speaks to the local weekly eleven news publication and adds that most of the dead were females.
she said the whole village would be crying in the storms if the world was devastated and some members of the family would die in a series of lying on the road.
she exclaimed, " i didn't find any dependents in laputta, but i rested in some pagoda pavilions that had shelter. "
she said that some well-wishers had donated millet gruel but she had to queue for it.
local doctors are worried about hygiene issues, as the disposal of urine of tens of thousands of homeless victims has developed and constitutes a health threat to tens of thousands of unsettled dead bodies.
cyclone nargis, a tropical cyclone that killed over 100,000 people over the bengal bay and covered 5 divisions and 45 towns in myanmar's biggest city yangon, which sustained the heaviest ever casualties and infrastructure damage, hit on may 2 and 3.
according to the latest official death toll updated until monday, 31938 people have lost their lives to the cyclone and 29770 people have remained missing altogether, with 1403 people injured.

the international atomic energy agency (iaea) has reached agreement with iranian officials stating that there are no remaining issues or ambiguities regarding iran's nuclear program and activities.
u.s. and european officials suspect that iran's civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials suspect that iran's civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
u.s. and european officials could impose a fourth round of sanctions on tehran as the u.n. security council is likely to consider iran's nuclear program in september 2007.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) distributed limited copies of a publication copying iaea reports before a meeting of 35 members of its board on 070911.
the findings reflect the agreement reached between tehran and the agency on 21 august 2007, publicized by iranian officials beginning 12 august 2007.
the accord says there are no issues or ambiguities regarding iran's nuclear program and iranian nuclear activities.
the reuters news agency said the iaea report said the step was a significant step forward in the work plan.
a senior u.n. official was quoted by reuters as saying iran's efforts to enrich uranium were slowing.
the iaea report stated that iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of iran's present and future nuclear program.
iranian officials stated on august 30, 2007 that iran would cooperate with the iaea to prevent further rounds of international sanctions.
iran's representative to the iaea, ali asghar soltanieh, stated to the fars news agency in tehran that the report emphasizes that there is no sign or evidence indicating diversion of iran's nuclear activities and that all of iran's nuclear material has been audited.
some non-proliferation experts stated that the iaea has ceded too much to iran.
in a criticism published august 19, 2007, david albright and jacqueline shire of the washington-based institute for science and international security, an arm control expert, wrote that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards and that the agreement does not specify that iranian officials will provide the iaea with access to key people, facilities and documents needed to verify that iran is answering the iaea's questions.
independent experts stated that iran's last agreement with the iaea to grant inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information was short of the west's demand that iran halt production of highly enriched uranium which could be used in a potential nuclear bomb.
u.s. state department spokesman tom casey stated that iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program but that the report may offer some new details or insights into iran's development of the program.
casey stated that the nuclear program is moving forward and shows that the iranian regime continues to defy the international community.
most non-proliferation experts in the west stated that the agreement of 070821 contained little that would dissuade policy makers in washington, london, paris and berlin from moving around another round of security council sanctions.
experts stated that the previous resolution of many of the transparency issues that were resolved by agreement on 21 august 2007 should be resolved.
daryl g. kimball, executive director of the arms control association in washington, d.c., said the agreement addresses the problem of iran's pursuit of enrichment technology and capabilities that could lead to the production of nuclear material for a bomb.
kimball stated the iranian government is designing to deflect criticism and pressure and claim progress.
iranian officials stated that more sanctions could reduce the possibility of collaboration between officials and inspectors.
the security council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on iran, but the penalties demanded by the u.s. are limited because of pressure from china and russia.
soltanieh stated in an interview on iranian state-controlled television that the report and the measures made any other international organization irrelevant and unjustified in intervening.

the document outlines israel's proposal for the nuclear suppliers group to allow international transfers of nuclear technology to non-signatories of the non-proliferation rules.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for india from nuclear trade restrictions.
israeli officials have convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines that would allow international transfers of nuclear technology to states that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
countries that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, including india, israel and pakistan, are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade, including purchases of reactors or uranium fuel or yellowcake.
in march 2007, 45 members of the nuclear suppliers group were distributed a document outlining israel's proposals.
israel's presentation was made on a paper that did not allow for official denials.
according to a letter from the nsg chairman, the israeli presentation was offered on march 17, 2007 in the context of the nsg debate on the indian bid for exemption.
only india and israel, among the non-signatories, qualify for admission to the nsg under the proposal.
israel's plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-treaty states in the nuclear field.
one criterion indicates israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and says that nuclear trade with israel should be allowed if israel applies stringent physical protection, control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons, facilities and material in its territory, all nuclear source materials and special nuclear materials in its territory.
the document circulated on capitol hill in september 2007 as the bush administration worked toward an agreement with indian officials.
arms control association executive director daryl kimball stated that the israeli document could affect the debate over india.
kimball stated --
at the nsg, officials from india and the united states do not want obstacles to the largest and most powerful countries in india and the united states.
reaching a consensus on india at the nsg meeting in november 2007 was difficult.
israeli proposals gave some officials reason to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
israel's record following international nuclear rules is good and better than india's.
the bush administration rejected israel's proposal, despite the fact that the israeli government is tied to the u.s. government.
the proposal could complicate the bush administration's efforts to win india an exemption from nuclear trade restrictions.
president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice view the pact as an important part of the bush administration's foreign policy legacy.
the deal is controversial in india and will have to be approved by congress.
the delay in winning approval for the india deal could negatively affect the administration's foreign policy legacy with the most negative effect coming from the delay in the election year.
state department spokesman tom casey stated that the u.s. government views the india deal as unique and does not see it as a precedent for any other country, including israel.
israeli embassy spokesman david siegel said the suggestion that the israeli government demanded exemptions or linked the effort to any other issue, including the india debate, was grossly inaccurate.
seigel stated --
the israeli government has never asked the nsg for exemption from the nsgs guidelines on nuclear supplies and has never made a specific request for israel.
israel is recognized as fully adhering to the nsg guidelines.
the israeli government urged the nsg to consider adopting a tiered, multi-tiered, generic approach to the transfer of nuclear technology based on criteria.
some nsg officials previously suggested an approach similar to israel's plan.
the non-proliferation regime would be considerably enhanced if the nsg guidelines were modified in the way proposed by israeli officials.

ahmadinejad announced that iran's uranium production capabilities have been expanded.
iran refuses to commit to halt expansion but hints that it may happen in the future.
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in mashhad northeast iran on july 26, 2008 that iran will expand its arsenal of centrifuges to produce enriched uranium over 5000.
ahmadinejad has stated that the expansion is the first since april 2008 when iran announced its approach to implementing 6000 centrifuges.
iran has articulated a goal of 50,000 centrifuges operating at an enrichment plant near natanz.
the international community has demanded that iran halt nuclear material production.
the number of centrifuges cited by ahmadinejad differs from media reports.
iranian news agency reported ahmadinejad stating iran has 6000 working centrifuges but subsequently removed the statement from the internet.
another iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100,000 centrifuges.
experts discount the significance of ahmadinejad's claims because of the absence of information on the function of the centrifuges.
western diplomats speaking anonymously in tehran stated that the number of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operating and efficient, and that ahmadinejad's assertions hinder resolution of the diplomatic standoff between iran and the west.
new america foundation arms control expert jeffrey g. lewis stated that new america foundation is aware of iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but is not aware of the operational status of the machines.
diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems have hindered iran's enrichment program.
iran repeated its assertion that its nuclear program is aimed only at producing electricity because the production of nuclear weapons contradicts islamic principles.
the us, israel, europe and the majority of western experts on arms control believe that iran is pursuing the capability to produce a bomb immediately if it so decides.
experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple.
ahmadinejad stated the west is still pursuing negotiations after iran resisted the west's demand that iran halt its nuclear activities.
eu foreign policy chief javier solana recently presented iran with two offers.
incentives to cease production of enriched uranium, endorsed by the us.
for six weeks, from the time iran was not adding centrifuges and the west refrained from promoting a fourth round of economic sanctions against iran to the un security council, the freeze was in place.
us officials repeated their statement that negotiations can not begin before iran halts all enrichment-related activities that can be verified, but the bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze and dispatched burns to geneva.
iran refused to respond to solana's offer on july 26, 2008 at talks in geneva attended by us undersecretary of state for foreign affairs william j. burns.
the talks constituted the highest level of diplomatic contact between the us and iran in nearly 30 years.
solana, burns and the european envoy set a deadline for iran to respond positively before they initiate new sanctions, including a prohibition on selling iran vital refined petroleum products.
iranian officials refused to commit to stopping the expansion or observing deadlines.
ahmadinejad appeared to suggest on july 26, 2008 that iran could potentially halt the expansion of its centrifuges at a higher number than previously expected over a six-week period.
ahmadinejad stated that the west consents to the existing and operating centrifuges between 5000 and 6000 if the number of centrifuges is not increased.
5000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if highly enriched.
6000 centrifuges running continuously could produce weapons-grade uranium for a single bomb in six months.
in may 2008 the international atomic energy agency stated that iran possessed 3500 operational centrifuges.

the paris diplomatic meeting concluded without agreement on further steps to pressure iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility.
on november 14, 2008, a diplomat stated to the media that at a meeting on november 13, 2008 in paris, united states, european, russian and chinese officials had not reached agreement to take further action to persuade iran to halt uranium enrichment at its natanz facility.
the process of uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants and fissile material for atomic weapons.
the meeting on november 13, 2008 ended without new measures announced.
the french foreign ministry released a statement after the 13 november meeting stating that the international community reaffirmed the importance of a dual-track approach of engagement through diplomacy and work towards sanctions.
russia and china resist new sanctions on iran.
russia and china are closely tied to iran politically and in business and do not feel domestic pressure to act against iran.
the united states and iran are not close politically or economically and iran feels domestic pressure to act against the united states.
russia and china hold veto power over security council decisions.
russian diplomat sergei ryabkov said at a meeting on november 13 that russia will not strike a deal on sanctions against iran and that western countries are in favor of sanctions but china and russia are not in support of them, interfax news agency in moscow reported.
ryabkov will attend the meeting on 13 november 2008.
a report released this week stated that iran has made significant progress on the heavy water research reactor facility near arak.
the heavy water reactor near the city of arak in iran could eventually produce plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons.
satellite images published by the institute for science and international security (isis) show significant progress in the construction of the heavy water research reactor (hrr) facility near arak from february 2008 to october 2008.
david albright stated that the heavy water reactor near the city of arak in iran for research purposes evaded notice by the international security community.
david albright stated that satellite images say that progress at the iranian heavy water research reactor near arak is significant and that the reactor has made significant progress from the building frame to a large finished facility in the last 1.5 years.
david albright, a former arms inspector and director of the washington, d.c.-based institute for science and international security.
iran states it will pursue nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research.
the united states and its western allies suspect iran has preceded its nuclear production efforts with the creation of a nuclear weapons infrastructure.
low-grade uranium production is legal under international arms control regulations.
iran ’s last nuclear technology development shows the incoming barack obama ’s united states foreign policy team a complex and technical-diplomatic challenge to take on the task of stopping iran from mastering the technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
the administration of president george w. bush of the united states managed to synchronize u.s. policy with the leaders of the european union, great britain, france and germany in the last month in power to press for tougher sanctions against iran and diplomatic action.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) is expected to release a report next week criticizing iran.
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) is a nuclear watchdog agency of the united nations.
the lack of new initiatives on iran's nuclear program at talks in paris on 13 november 2008 decreased hopes that another set of united nations security council sanctions would be imposed before the end of president bush's term.
iran continues to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology while maneuvering diplomatically.
some israeli officials stated that iran's test firing of a two-stage solid-fuel rocket with a range of 1,200 miles this week alarmed israel.

the russian high-security laboratory complex that stores anthrax, the plague and other deadly bacteria faces losing electricity because it lacks payment to the electricity utility mosenergo.
a large repository of deadly anthrax, plague and other bacteria is threatened by loss of electricity at a high-security russian laboratory complex 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of moscow.
recently, officials from moscow region's electricity utility mosenergo arrived at the russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity due to lack of payment.
the russian laboratory complex consists of 90 buildings and served as the location of a secret biological weapons program during the soviet era.
the incorrect headline in the izvestia newspaper stated that the moscow region's regional depository was a threat to the city.
the virus is at the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
every kind of bacterium studied for use in the soviet union's secret biological weapons program is at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
there are large virus repositories in siberia.
russian and western officials stated that the power cut-off at the state scientific center of applied microbiology is unlikely to result in any public health threat.
russian and western officials stated that there is not enough certainty to know why the loss of power at the state scientific center of applied microbiology could not have been the cause of the public health threat.
nikolai n. urakov, a general, stated by telephone that the state scientific center of applied microbiology has a quite reliable system of protection in case of emergency.
nikolai n. urakov, longtime director of the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the state scientific center of applied microbiology is working with western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedicine manufacturing site.
nikolai n. urakov, a general, said by telephone that the researchers at the state scientific center of applied microbiology were scared by this threat of sudden electricity shutdown, because of the psychological pressure it puts on them.
nikolai n. urakov, a general, stated by telephone that scientists would have to destroy all ongoing bacteriological experiments if the power was shut down at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
nikolai urakov, a general, said the united states and western countries had contributed about 6 million dollars to transform the former bioweapons complex and that another 5 million dollars would be paid to the sscm annually to pay electric bills and arrears.
american scientists working at the closely affiliated state scientific center of applied microbiology stated that the russian government is responsible for paying the research institute's electric bills.
western aid to convert one of general nikolai urakov's bioweapons laboratories peaked in 1997 after learning that iran had offered to purchase research experts from the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
the crisis is being orchestrated by russian scientists and military leaders who are dependent on western financing to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and who know that financing will increase in the sense of the crisis.
american scientist randall lee beatty is working to convert the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk.
beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity at the state scientific and applied microbiology center is a crisis.
randall lee beatty is the director of the international science and technology center.
the international science and technology center (istc) financed approximately half of the budget of about 350 russian biowarfare scientists and technicians, including general nikolai n. urakov.
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific and applied microbiology center has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months.
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific center of applied microbiology is one of the world's most important locations for archiving dangerous pathogens and that it is a shame that the location was destroyed because of the lack of electricity payments.
approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the state scientific center of applied microbiology and many others are stored in cryogenic casks cooled by liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversized air handling systems all dependent on electricity for function.
defrosting of live germs preserved in the current state of freezing is the greatest danger from the shutdown of the electric power at the state scientific center of applied microbiology.
biological warfare expert raymond zilinskas of monterey institute of international studies stated that the main threat is that the power of the state scientific center of applied microbiology is being cut instead of the threat of the possibility of the escape of the organisms.
raymond zilinskas stated that in the worst case scenario, bacteria would be defrosted at -70 degrees and that the clean up afterward would be a real mess because it is not certain that all the bacteria would die.
another example is mosenergo electricity utility confronting the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk, where the basic capitalist imperative of enterprise self-sustainability can dangerously clash with the old soviet-science weapon science.
the russian national power company cut off electricity at a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood at high alert because of an overdue power bill in 2000.
nuclear missile silos will not lose power.
arm troops marched to the substation and turned the power back on.
united energy systems, a national company, cut power at a number of military installations around russia in january and february 2001.
the kamchatka center for monitoring the russian space forces is one of the military installations that have lost power.
in most cases where military installations cut off electricity, restoration is quick.
investigations often show that the utility and military tug-of-war forces the military to spend electricity power budget funds instead of diverting money to other useful things.
building a residence in the country for the general is part of some budgeted funds that are sometimes cut.

brazil has implemented a law that allows the brazilian air force to target drug-trafficking aircraft in brazilian airspace.
the us is concerned about liability if a civilian plane is misidentified.
brazil announced that the air force would begin shooting down aircraft used for illegal drug trafficking in brazil's airspace.
the plan requires eight precautionary steps before an order to shoot down a plane can be issued.
prior to the policy taking effect in late october 2004, the publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they needed to file a flight plan.
the law permitting such actions was originally approved in 1998 but president fernando henrique cardoso never put the policy into effect.
the united states dissuaded cardoso from signing the decree because of concerns that the accidental downing of a civilian aircraft could expose the government and companies to lawsuits, the amr graph said.
in april 2001 the united states reduced its support for an anti-drug-running operation after a peruvian jet shot down a small plane that was misidentified as a drug carrier and killed a peruvian missionary and her child.
the relatives of the victims sued the us government and won a settlement from the us government for providing intelligence and technical support for the operation.
a us state department official stated --
under certain conditions, the us law could forbid assistance to countries that implement the shoot-down law.
the us agrees with brazil's assessment that the threat from drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
the us government consulted the brazilian government on provisions of brazilian law.
brazilian defense minister jose viegas stated that brazil has encountered difficulties in securing us support for the plan but recent bilateral talks have led to a certainty that the brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing brazil to commercial sanctions.
brazilian officials expressed hope that the us would endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
the us has scheduled 102 million dollars in drug aid and law enforcement aid for brazil for 2004.
former air force chief and current director of the air institute of the estacio de sa university in rio de janeiro, general mauro jose miranda gandra stated that the government's measure is a courageous step but that politics with more impact than practical impact can occur because of the restrictions imposed by the brazilian government.
brazilian officials stated that the policy does not apply to aircraft with children on board.
viegas stated that there is a need for limits.
gandra stated that the provision undermines the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug-smuggling aircraft carrying children, thereby introducing the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
viegas stated in an interview in brasilia that the government would use the law to more powerfully dissuade drug traffickers from entering brazilian airspace, previously feeling no threat from the air force.
the deterioration of the public security situation in sao paolo and particularly rio de janeiro, with increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs, has prompted the government to act.
drug gangs in rio de janeiro have more firepower than the police, have successfully attacked police stations and have forced businesses and schools to close.
president luiz inacio lula da silva stated in an interview with a foreign correspondent in 2003 that --
national sovereignty and national security are policy matters.
some pilots of drug-running aircraft feel so confident of their immunity to retribution that they gesture obscenely at brazilian air force pilots in pursuit.
under brazil's prohibition of the death penalty for criminal acts, is the constitution a law?
some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounted to a de facto death sentence for drug traffickers, contrary to government claims.
the o estado de sao paolo newspaper in a daily editorial stated that the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefit.
the application of extrajudicial penalties by the air force commander is an administrative decision.
these people gain power over the lives and deaths of crew members and regular flyers.
brazil inaugurated the 140 million dollar sivam radar system in 2002 which allows the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive amazon region for the first time.
the system uses united states technology.
illegal flights initially declined 30 % due to concern that improved tracking capabilities would cause traffickers to reaccelerate, but subsequent illegal flights have reaccelerated.
brazil recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003.
some of these flights are illegal, as innocent ranchers flying between plantations in the amazon.
viegas stated that the deliberate violation of brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who apparently realize the government is incapable of retaliation has increased significantly.
fernandinho beira-mar, the most notorious drug boss in rio de janeiro, was captured in colombia in april 2001 in a gun pipeline for drugs involving leftist guerrillas.
the northern amazon corridor of brazil has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
routes of the most important drug and gun smuggling routes for supplying cocaine to europe are reportedly run from colombia to suriname across the northern tier of the amazon basin.
colombia is the only country with a current policy of targeting drug-trafficking aircraft.
colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the united states.

venezuelan president's deal with russia on weapons, curbs on military cooperation with the united states and plans to train as many as 2 million venezuelan civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion has worried venezuela and its domestic critics.
chavez's plans to deal with russia over weapons, curb military cooperation with russia and plan to train as many as 2 million civilians to repel a possible imperialist invasion by the united states and domestic critics of chavez have worried the united states and domestic critics of chavez.
chavez insisted the move was purely defensive and that venezuela's military hardware was overdue for an update and to protect the country from possible nations that might want to control venezuela.
venezuela is the largest petroleum-producing state in south america.
domestic opponents of chavez scoff at the idea of a us invasion of venezuela and charge that chavez truly intends to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists to protect against any internal rising and to pose a militarized counterweight to the us's influence in latin america.
castro is a major ally of chavez and the two have grown closer.
detractors of chavez in the us government say that chavez's strategy of restructuring venezuelan democracy in the image of a militarized style of socialism of the cuban variety, and fomenting a leftist revolution throughout south america, could even more troubled by chavez's purchases of arms and indoctrination of civilian militias.
us strategic military officials said they were increasingly concerned about the potential fomenting of such a revolution by radical moves inspired by chavez.
latin american politics has shifted leftward since the late 1990 s.
this leftward shift is largely a reaction to the perceived failure of free market economics.
leftists elected to lead brazil, argentina, chile, uruguay, ecuador and venezuela.
supporters of chavez at home counter that the united states has a long history of open and covert intervention in the domestic politics of latin america and say that the united states has no right to question venezuela's preparations for defense.
carlos roque espinoza leon said venezuelans never asked what us marines do.
espinoza leon, a chavez supporter, is a specialist in defense in venezuela's national assembly.
espinoza said peru has 500,000 rifles and no one is saying anything.
espinoza said no one complained that colombia is the most militarized country in latin america.
espinoza said the us history is full of aggression in latin america.
espinoza said venezuelans must do whatever is necessary to protect the country.
chavez said in a famous speech that the so-called bolivarian revolution in venezuela was peaceful but armed.
chavez was first elected in 1998 and according to an independent poll by the firm datanalisis, his popularity rate is 71 percent.
venezuelan military analyst alberto garrido said chavez is looking to his allies in russia, china and iran to promote a multi-polar world that would counteract us dominance and encourage grass-roots movements in latin america to throw off government influence.
farmer lorenzo campos in the northern venezuelan state of anzoategui and the reservists trained by him.
campos said venezuelans want the world to know they are not prepared to attack anyone and that their mission is to protect the country.
in may 2005 the chavez government announced details of a deal with a russian firm to purchase 100,000 ak-103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each for 18.6 million dollars and the transfer of technology to venezuela to manufacture the rifles.
the deal works out to $ 186.22 per rifle.
this price is considerably less than the $ 825 - $ 850 price for the same weapon ordered through the us mail.
the venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 russian helicopters, 10 spanish transport planes and 6 naval craft from russia.
venezuelan officials said the government had negotiated with brazil to buy around 24 air support and train planes.
chavez insisted and even the staunchest of his critics here, retired military, agreed that the purchase was essential to update old weapons such as the fal, which is decades old and belgian military.
retired general fernando ochoa antich said that the statement that chavez is engaged in an arms buildup is an exaggeration.
ochoa was defense minister in 1992 during the failed chavez coup.
ochoa stated that venezuela has not purchased arms in the past 25 years and that chavez has not bought weapons aggressively or threateningly towards his neighbors.
ochoa said venezuela never before bought arms from russia and suggested chavez bought arms to become independent of the us.
ochoa asked why chavez would buy the popular rifle caliber among subversive forces in latin america and stated that chavez's political support for radical leftist moves makes him a continental menace.
the pentagon has openly questioned what chavez is doing with the old fal rifles and whether he can share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in latin america.
the us government has provided no evidence that chavez is arming or funding a leftist insurgency.
military analysts who analyze colombian guerrilla of the farc and military specialists say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and are not interested in old rifles from belgium or chavez's assistance.
a 2003 study published by the us defense intelligence agency reported that more than half of the weapons seized from colombian guerrillas between 1998 and 2001 originated in venezuela.
implying that corrupt or sympathetic venezuelan military members could aid the guerrillas.
the critic said that the ideological military-reservist training chavez's domestic opponents were more distressed by was in mind, which chavez critics said was an ideological military-reservist training for chavez's domestic opponents.
in 2005 chavez called for so-called revolutionary units to start preparing the public for resistance to the superpower aggressor and said resistance would be the first step in training the millions of volunteers coming in the years to come to back up the active duty armed forces.
military analysts estimate venezuela's active duty armed forces number 83000.
the person's own defense unit was created in neighborhoods, state companies and the free university established under chavez, and reports directly to the president.
the government insists that the reserve supports the armed forces and will not act against a possible chavez coup in the fifth column.
espinoza said reserves should not be used for any shock troops and that each person would have to decide which side to be on in a civil war.
general julio ramon quintero viloria is the reserve commander.
quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians in the second half of 2005 at a rate of 20 per weekend and that 300,000 more civilians could be trained in 2006.
quintero said venezuelans don't want any colony of any empire and are ready for any possibility.
in june 2005, 100000 reservists and the venezuelan navy engaged in a massive war game to repel an invading country that was stronger than venezuela.
in june 2005, 40 state oil company employees participated in a similar exercise with 1,200 soldiers.
chavez's circle of supporters here warns of asymmetrical warfare.
asymmetric warfare is a term coined by us strategic military planners to describe conflicts between unequal combatants in which the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
the us government has given colombia $ 330 million in military aid over the past five years.
chavez loyalists fear that the us government could instigate a proxy war between colombia and venezuela in order to oust chavez and control venezuelan oil.
in interviews, senior us officials dismissed the notion that the us government wants to invade venezuela as completely and utterly nonsensical.
officials said the chavez side wished to make a negative relationship because they calculated politically that mr. chavez would reach power by constantly confronting the us.
another rollback for chavez: military cooperation and joint exercises are developing, troubling the united states.
for 50 years, the us military has had a cooperation office at venezuela's fort.
in 2004 chavez shut it down.
5 us military trainees and students participating in the exchange program will be ordered to leave the country in april 2005.
analysts say chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
analysts say chavez's use of that force to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere is unproven.

somali pirates who hijacked a ukrainian freighter carrying large cargo of arms approached a deal to release the ship.
questions emerge regarding arms shipments through the route to kenya and possibly clandestine arms deals between kenya and south sudan.
on 08 october 2008 maritime officials and associates of somali pirates who hijacked the ukrainian freighter carrying large cargo of arms on 25 september 2008 stated that the pirates could collect a ransom for the freighter soon.
after difficult negotiations involving several people involved in haggling in a bazaar style, the party is close to reaching a deal that would pay pirates millions of dollars and free the ship.
somalia businessman ahmed omar in xarardheere stated pirates had agreed to ransom a ship's owners approximately 8 million u.s. dollars to pirates and the ship could be freed on october 8 or 9, 2008.
xarardheere, a notorious pirate base on the somali coast.
kenyan maritime officials stated that there are yet to be agreements on critical details.
one such detail involves pirate requests for guarantees that the current armada of united states warships encircling pirates will not arrest or attack pirates.
kenyan maritime officials stated that such negotiations are complex and involve more than just financial aspects.
officials stated on october 8, 2008 that progress was made and the parties were approaching an agreement.
the pirates initially requested 35 million u.s. dollars and then reduced it to 20 million u.s. dollars.
the pirates consistently express a willingness to negotiate on financial figures.
more than 25 ships were hijacked off the somali coast in 2008 for ransom typically between $ 1 and $ 2 million in u.s. dollars.
pirates who boarded a ukrainian ship stated they would release the ship and its cargo and the 20 sailors on board in exchange for payment of $ 100 us dollars or the pirates preferred $ 100 bills.
the original destination country of the arms shipments that boarded ukrainian ships:
shortly after the hijacking of the freighter on september 25, 2008 the kenyan government claimed that the weapons were being shipped to the kenyan military.
ships via the main kenyan port of mombasa.
the weapons on board included 33 t-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
subsequently, evidence emerged of weapons in kenya's clandestine arms deal with the separatist region in southern sudan.
if the pirates did not hijack the ship and did not begin speaking to the media via satellite phone, the deal is most likely to remain secret.
ukrainian officials are adamant that there was no wrongdoing.
ukrainian diplomat oleh belokolos in kenya stated --
ukraine has no supplies of any armaments to the government of south sudan and has no plans to do so.
all appropriate paperwork will be validated.
ukraine will abide by all united nations rules and agreements on arms control.
ukraine inherited an enormous stockpile of weaponry from the soviet union after its collapse and now deals in major arms.
kenya's reliance on the united kingdom and other western countries for heavy weapons supplies is considered suspicious because kenya deals with ukraine.
several commissions have been called upon by kenyan politicians to answer questions and examine the situation.
southern sudan is an autonomous region currently increasing its military use of soviet-designed tanks.
the united states military stated that it would prioritize ensuring that the ship does not unload weapons and that the weapons are not sold to islamist insurgents in somalia.
pirates denied any interest in the weapons and claimed they were unaware tanks were among the cargo when they hijacked the ship.
last week, pirate spokesman sugule ali stated in an interview that the pirates' sole interest in the deal was money.

u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said afghanistan produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium to support the price and preserve a major source of insurgent financing.
u.n. drug office head antonio maria costa said afghanistan produced so much opium in recent years that the taliban cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium to support the price and preserve the major source of insurgent financing.
costa told reporters last week as the u.n. drug office prepared to release its latest survey of afghanistan's opium crop.
the survey showed that poppy cultivation has retreated much in afghanistan and is overwhelmingly concentrated in the 7 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, most of which are in the south.
the survey was issued on 27 november 2008.
the united nations found that the amount of land devoted to opium in afghanistan was reduced by 19 percent despite a just 6 percent drop in total opium production.
the study attributes high output to one acre to a good growing season in the south.
the heavy irrigation area of the south, where the taliban maintain a strong presence in five provinces and systematically encourage opium cultivation to finance their insurgency for several years.
the u.n. estimated that insurgents made much of the $ 300 million from opium trading last year.
costa said a lot of the war effort could be funded between 2 million and 300 million dollars.
the taliban produced an amount of opium far in excess of world demand for three successive bumper crops.
costa said the result would be a glut that would depress prices that have dropped approximately 20 percent.
costa said the absence of a collapse in prices already was evidence that taliban, drug lords and even some farmers were stockpiling opium.
in afghanistan, the amount of opium processed also increased.
costa added that insurgents were holding a significant amount of opium.
costa said the surplus was as much as 11,000 tons (18,000 tons), or more than twice the world's demand three years ago, and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
the united nations found that afghanistan produced 8,500 tons of opium in 2008.
world demand is estimated at about 4400 tons per year.
the taliban stood passively by while the opium crop was cultivated this year and put less pressure on afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
then this supports the current price.

a document signed by a former high-ranking peruvian army officer and disclosed on july 25, 2002 mentions drug trafficking links and could further compromise the situation of former head of the country's national intelligence service vladimiro montesinos.
according to the front page story of el comercio, peru's nationwide daily newspaper, montesinos may have authorized drug deals with the leader of the military of alto huallaga to find the leaders of the shining path rebel group and the tupac amaru revolutionary movement.
the province of alto huallaga is located northeast of the capital lima.
the story is based on a final report from the attorney general's office.

the el comercio newspaper said that the intelligence operation named " scorpion " put into effect by then president alberto fujimori's government in 1992 to fight off terrorism and drug trafficking in the amazon region.
several agents infiltrated the group as part of the scorpion plan to gather information on the main rebel commanders and drug traffickers.
additionaly, the cocaine transportation orders also served to cover up for the agents.
montesinos was a close adviser to former peruvian president alberto fujimori.
fujimori resigned in november over the bribery scandal and is now in lima prison on alleged connections to the scandal.
